    "O'Brien v. Detty",
    "Roe, J.\nPlaintiff was a tenant in a house owned by defendant Detty. (Martin Detty will be referred to, in this opinion, as the sole defendant.) During a long rain, water leaked in around a window, and some collected on the floor. Plaintiff immediately reported this to the defendant and requested that it be repaired. The defendant-landlord twice, within a week of being notified, attempted but failed to locate and remedy the problem. About 2 weeks after giving notice of this condition, the plaintiff slipped in some water and sustained the injuries of which she complains in this action. About 2 weeks after her fall; the defendant succeeded in finding and repairing the leak. The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant.\nThe Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, modified the common law so as to require decent, safe and sanitary housing. RCW 59.18.040(4). It also requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in reasonably weathertight condition. RCW 59.18.060(8). The sole issue is: Was the statute violated by the mere existence of a prohibited defect in the rented premises, or does the statute instead give a landlord a reasonable time to effect repairs? Plaintiff argues that the defendant violated these sections of the act by allowing the defect to exist, and that such a violation is negligence per se. She thus claims the right to recover for any injuries resulting from the violation.\nSpecifically, the plaintiff assigns as error that part of the court's instruction No. 11 which stated:\nBefore the landlord can be held to have violated this st\u00e1tute, he must know or in the exercise of reasonable care should know of the existence of a condition which does not conform to the statutory requirements. It is for you to determine whether such a condition existed. After notice of such condition, the landlord has a reasonable time in which to effect repairs.\nThe trial court apparently instructed on the principles expressed in Franklin v. Fischer, 34 Wn.2d 342, 348, 208 P.2d 902 (1949):\nUnder the general rules of law applicable to such situations, a lessee, before any damages can be recovered from a lessor for breach of a covenant to keep in repair, would have to establish timely notice to the lessor of the need for repairs, and that the lessor failed to make them within a reasonable time under the circumstances. The rule is well stated by Judge Hay in Asheim v. Fahey, 170 Ore. 330, 133 P. (2d) 246, 145 A. L. R. 861, in these words:\n\" In the absence of a special agreement to make repairs upon the demised premises, a landlord is under no duty to do so. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, section 705. He may, of course, by the terms of his lease, covenant to make repairs, but the law in that connection is that he must have timely notice of the need for repairs before he is obliged to make them. If, after such notice and a reasonable opportunity to make the repairs, the landlord fails to do so, and damage to the tenant or his invitees results, the landlord may be held liable. Ashman v. Nichols, 92 Or. 223, 234, 180 P. 510 [(1919)]; Teel v. Steinbach Estate, 135 Or. 501, 504, 296 P. 1069 [(1931)].\nThe statute essentially adds such a covenant to repair, on the part of the landlord, to most residential rental agreements.\nROW 59.18.070 states that \"reasonable time for the landlord to commence remedial action\", after notice, is not more than 30 days in all cases, except for certain enumerated emergencies not applicable here. The published version of the act contained this provision during the trial and appeal. However, after the appeal was perfected, our Supreme Court in Washington Ass'n of Apartment Ass'ns, Inc. v. Evans, 88 Wn.2d 563, 564 P.2d 788 (1977), restored to the act certain provisions which the Governor had ostensibly, but invalidly, vetoed.\nOne vetoed provision was the last paragraph of RCW 59.18.070, which provides that where there are circumstances beyond a landlord's control, he shall endeavor to remedy a defective condition with all reasonable speed. In holding that veto invalid, the court stated that that vetoed portion had taken away an excuse from timely compliance which otherwise would have been available to the landlord, Washington Ass'n of Apartment Ass'ns, Inc. v. Evans, supra at 567.\nEvidence presented at trial by the defendant indicated that he promptly investigated the trouble, but had difficulty determining the cause. The jury could have found that he endeavored to remedy the condition with all reasonable speed. We believe, since the statute gives a landlord such leeway, that no violation arises until a reasonable time has passed. The notice and time provisions in the statute negative the idea that a landlord is absolutely liable for any defects, which would be a far departure from common law. A landlord's present position and duties are no different than those of a landlord who covenants to repair, as set out in Franklin v. Fischer, supra. There was no error in the trial court's instruction.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nMunson, C.J., and Green, J., concur.\nReconsideration denied April 18, 1978.\nReview denied by Supreme Court October 6, 1978.",

    "United Mutual Savings Bank v. Riebli",
    "Ott, J.\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \u201ctake good care\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\nNor does the covenant (\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\u2019 assignor.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\nWeaver, C.

            "text": "Ott, J.\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease.

            "text": "Hunter, J.\n(dissenting)\u2014A more detailed statement of the facts is necessary to better understand the reasoning of this dissent.\nThe record discloses that the appellant lessees, in the conduct of their business, maintained and operated a motor-driven compressor as a part of their refrigeration equipment situated within the premises, which compressor required a constant supply of water for cooling purposes; that the lessees, in the conduct of their business, obtained water from the Building Company for various uses on their premises, for which they paid a monthly flat fee to the lessor; that they obtained their water supply by means of an entrance pipe through the floor of their premises, connected to the general building water supply system.\nThe testimony in the record, which the trial court was entitled to believe, discloses that immediately inside appellants\u2019 premises on the entrance pipe was a hand-operated control valve by which the flow of water beyond that point could be turned off and on; that from that point on water was distributed to the various points of use within appellants\u2019 premises by plumbing installed by previous tenants; that in order to supply cold water to the appellants\u2019 refrigeration compressor, a pipe, connected with the other plumbing within the premises, was placed under the surface of the floor of their premises; that the floor was laid by a prior tenant; that the flow of water in the pipe was controlled by the same valve within the premises that controlled the flow through the rest of the plumbing; that one of the appellants, George Hoertrich, Jr., was the electrical contractor for the tenant who installed the floor and pipe, and did the electrical work incident to the installation of the compressor, which was the same compressor situated on the premises maintained and operated by the appellants, when the accident occurred on October 29,1956. The record further shows that the pipe was installed on the floor of the premises by being laid upon or partially recessed therein, and was covered with a one' to two-inch terrazzo floor, which is a type of floor laid similar to concrete with the same hardening characteristics; that the original floor was of twelve-inch reinforced concrete, and beneath this floor there is an area of approximately two feet followed by a false ceiling suspended over respondents\u2019 premises. The space between the false ceiling and the concrete floor contains various utilities for the building. In its determination of the source of the escaping water, the trial court found that it resulted from a rupture in the pipeline in the terrazzo floor.\nIn view of the result of this dissent, it is necessary to discuss certain contentions of the appellants in addition to those considered by the majority. Hence, for continuity, all of the appellants\u2019 contentions will be discussed in order, without reference to the majority opinion.\nAppellants contend first, that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was from a rupture of the pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises. I disagree. The building superintendent testified that the water was running through the ceiling directly beneath the appellants\u2019 premises when the damage was discovered; that there was no other plumbing in that area except the appellants\u2019 plumbing; and that he immediately notified the appellants. The record shows that the appellants thereupon called a plumber who shut off the water at the valve through which the water flows into the appellants\u2019 plumbing from the line of the building supplying the water to appellants\u2019 premises. The water leakage promptly subsided. The plumber bypassed the pipe in the floor, which went to the appellants\u2019 compressor, with copper tubing to carry the water and there was no further difficulty encountered. The building superintendent further testified that, based on his years of experience in maintenance and plumbing work, he believed the break could be caused by a chemical reaction between the galvanizing of the pipe and the concrete floor.\nConsidering the testimony in its entirety and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was a ruptured pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises.\nThe appellants further contend the trial court erred in finding that the appellants had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing the damage. The appellants contend the control was in the lessor. I believe an examination of the record discloses the contrary. The lease expressly provides:\n\u201cThroughout the term of this lease, the lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep the same in good repair, . . . and, at the end of the term, the lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted.\u201d (Italics mine.)\nThe court found, as supported by the record, that the ruptured pipe was a part of the plumbing used exclusively in the operation of the appellants\u2019 business. The pipe could be used for that purpose only, and was not in any manner related to the use of the remainder of the building. The ruptured pipe was clearly a part of, and appurtenant to the use of, the demised premises, which the appellants were bound to maintain and repair under the lease and over which they necessarily had control under these circumstances. The appellants argue, however, that they did not have exclusive control since they could not disturb the terrazzo floor without permission of the lessor, on the theory that it would constitute an alteration requiring the consent of the lessor, as provided in the lease. I disagree. The lease must be read in its entirety. The disturbing of the floor would only be an incident to the appellants\u2019 obligation to repair the pipe and would not be an alteration, since the restoration of the floor would be required under the provision of the lease providing for the surrender of the premises in good order and condition at the end of the term (reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted).\nThe appellants further contend that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable in this case. The doctrine was recently considered by this court in the case of Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958). There we stated:\n\u201cUnder our recent decision in Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811, the rule is:\n\u201c Where a plaintiff\u2019s evidence establishes that an instrumentality under the exclusive control of the defendants caused an injurious occurrence, which ordinarily does not happen if those in control of the instrumentality use ordinary care, there is an inference, permissible from the occurrence itself, that it was caused by the defendant\u2019s want of care. Nopson v. Wockner, 40 Wn. (2d) 645, 245 P. (2d) 1022. Legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality which caused the injury and a superior, if not exclusive, position for knowing or obtaining knowledge of the facts which caused the injury, provide a sufficient basis for the application of the doctrine. Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099. When these circumstances are shown, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and it devolves upon the defendant to produce evidence to meet and offset the effect of the presumption. Hogland v. Klein, supra.\u2019 \u201d (Italics mine.)\nIn the instant case, finding of fact No. 9 reads as follows:\n\u201cThat the Defendants, Arthur Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing said damage, and that the cause of said occurrence has not been satisfactorily explained, nor have said Defendants shown that they exercised due care to prevent the happening of the occurrence or excused themselves for their failure to do so.\u201d\nThe above finding, which is supported by the record, shows that (1) the appellants had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the damage; (2) that no showing was made by the appellants of their exercise of due care to prevent the occurrence causing the damage; and (3) that no explanation has been made by the appellants to excuse them from failing to exercise due care in the control and operation of the instrumentality causing the damage.\nUnder the facts in the instant case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, as stated in the Klise case, supra, applies. The appellants have failed to produce evidence to offset the effect of the presumption of the appellants\u2019 want of due care and they should therefore be liable for the damage incurred.\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding judgment for damages to the building on the Building Company\u2019s cross-complaint against the appellants, and in awarding the Building Company a judgment against the appellants for any damages it may sustain as a result of the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants. I do not agree. The covenant under the lease expressly provides the lessees will hold the lessor harmless from any and all damages occurring to the lessor whatsoever, as a result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of the premises. The lease states:\n\u201cThe lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of, the occupancy by, or under, the lessee, the lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the lessee, or any failure on the lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the lessee.\u201d\nThe damage sustained by the Building Company, as alleged in the cross-complaint, and resulting from the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants, was a direct result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of its premises, and the court was therefore correct in its ruling.\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding damages to the Washington Camera Mart for the loss of anticipated profits from the Christmas business of that year. The trial court was justified in finding that, as a result of the damage occurring on October 29,1956, there was insufficient time for any of the stock of damaged merchandise to be replaced. The finding of lost profits was properly supported by the record, showing that the Camera Mart had been in operation since 1946, and that the Christmas seasons of 1955 and 1956 were comparable as far as general Christmas buisness was concerned.\nFinding no error in the record, the trial court should be affirmed.\nMallery and Rosellini, JJ., concur with Hunter, J.",

    "McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp.",
    "REVIEW GRANTED BY SUPREME COURT\nPetrie, J.\nTwo tenants living in an apartment complex instituted independent actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent maintenance of common passageways. Tenant McCutcheon alleged injuries from a fall down an unlighted interior stairway. Tenant Fuller alleged injuries when he fell down an exterior wooden stairway. Both tenants had previously signed a lease which contained the following exculpatory clause:\nThat neither the Lessor, nor his Agent, shall be liable for any injury to Lessee, his family, guests or employees or any other person entering the premises or the building of which the demised premises are a part.\nThe landlord, in each lawsuit, set up as an affirmative defense the exculpatory provision of the lease and moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motions and dismissed the complaints. Both tenants appeal from the summary judgment and their appeals have been consolidated.\nThe scope of the exculpatory clause is not questioned because the tenants concede that if the clause is valid, it is an effective bar to their lawsuit. The sole issue presented upon this appeal is the validity of exculpatory clauses appearing within residential lease agreements. Tenants contend that such clauses are void as against the public policy of the state of Washington.\nThe prevailing rule in regards to the validity of exculpatory agreements is succinctly stated in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 574 (1932) at 1079:\nA bargain for exemption from liability for the consequences of negligence not falling greatly below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm, is legal except in the cases stated in \u00a7 575.\nIt is clear that Washington follows the restatement rule. Broderson v. Rainier Nat\u2019l Park Co., 187 Wash. 399, 60 P.2d 234 (1936); Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc., 27 Wn.2d 901, 182 P.2d 18 (1947), wherein the court in each instance declared that the exculpatory agreements in question were not repugnant to this state\u2019s public policy. In Griffiths, the court cited, and in Broderson, the court quoted the above passage from the restatement.\nThe stated exceptions contained in \u00a7 575 of the restatement prohibit contractual exculpation from the consequences of (1) willful breach of duty; (2) simple breach of duty arising out of the employment relationship; and (3) breach of duty by a person charged with a duty of public service.\nMost courts, which have been called upon to determine the question, have upheld the validity of exculpatory clauses appearing within residential or apartment lease agreements. See Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, 228 Md. 477, 180 A.2d 486 (1962) and cases and texts cited therein. The relatively few courts which have declared such agreements invalid have done so on the strength of specific legislation, such as public housing codes, which place affirmative public duties upon landlords. Feldman v. Stein Bldg. & Lumber Co., 6 Mich. App. 180, 148 N.W.2d 544 (1967); Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, Inc., 33 N.J. Super. 575, 111 A.2d 425 (1955). In addition, three states, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York, have enacted specific legislation declaring such agreements to be void. New Hampshire prohibits any waiver of the common law duty of ordinary care. Papakalos v. Shaka, 91 N. H. 265, 18 A.2d 377 (1941).\nTenants in the instant case have made no contention that the exculpatory clause contravenes any Washington statute, nor has our attention been called to any such enactment. Tenants do, however, contend that the case of Thomas v. Housing Auth., 71 Wn.2d 69, 426 P.2d 836 (1967) supports their position. Because of the difference in the character and relationship of the parties to the agreement in Thomas, that case is not determinative of the issue here presented. The landlord in the Thomas case was charged with a statutory public duty of providing safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income. The court therefore held that such a statutory duty could not be waived. This is in accord with the exceptions to the general rule as stated in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 575.\nIn light of this state\u2019s policy of validating exculpatory agreements in general, Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc., supra, and in the absence of any legislative expression to the contrary, we can discern no public policy which is violated by the exculpatory clause in question. We view this as an area for distinct concern because of the potentiality for unwarranted abuse, but nevertheless deem this a subject peculiarly appropriate for legislative, rather than judicial, action.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nArmstrong, C. J., and Pearson, J., concur.\nMaryland\u2019s prohibitory statute was enacted ' subsequent to the court\u2019s opinion in Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, supra.",

In Griffiths, the court cited, and in Broderson, the court quoted the above passage from the restatement.\nThe stated exceptions contained in \u00a7 575 of the restatement prohibit contractual exculpation from the consequences of (1) willful breach of duty; (2) simple breach of duty arising out of the employment relationship; and (3) breach of duty by a person charged with a duty of public service.\nMost courts, which have been called upon to determine the question, have upheld the validity of exculpatory clauses appearing within residential or apartment lease agreements. See Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, 228 Md. 477, 180 A.2d 486 (1962) and cases and texts cited therein. The relatively few courts which have declared such agreements invalid have done so on the strength of specific legislation, such as public housing codes, which place affirmative public duties upon landlords. Feldman v. Stein Bldg. & Lumber Co., 6 Mich. App. 180, 148 N.W.2d 544 (1967); Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, Inc., 33 N.J. Super. 575, 111 A.2d 425 (1955). In addition, three states, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York, have enacted specific legislation declaring such agreements to be void. New Hampshire prohibits any waiver of the common law duty of ordinary care. Papakalos v. Shaka, 91 N. H. 265, 18 A.2d 377 (1941).\nTenants in the instant case have made no contention that the exculpatory clause contravenes any Washington statute, nor has our attention been called to any such enactment. Tenants do, however, contend that the case of Thomas v. Housing Auth., 71 Wn.2d 69, 426 P.2d 836 (1967) supports their position. Because of the difference in the character and relationship of the parties to the agreement in Thomas, that case is not determinative of the issue here presented. The landlord in the Thomas case was charged with a statutory public duty of providing safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income. The court therefore held that such a statutory duty could not be waived. This is in accord with the exceptions to the general rule as stated in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 575.\nIn light of this state\u2019s policy of validating exculpatory agreements in general, Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc., supra, and in the absence of any legislative expression to the contrary, we can discern no public policy which is violated by the exculpatory clause in question. We view this as an area for distinct concern because of the potentiality for unwarranted abuse, but nevertheless deem this a subject peculiarly appropriate for legislative, rather than judicial, action.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nArmstrong, C. J., and Pearson, J., concur.\nMaryland\u2019s prohibitory statute was enacted ' subsequent to the court\u2019s opinion in Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, supra.",

I recognize there is a disparity in bargaining power in many contracts, but when that disparity is accompanied by the tendency of exculpatory clauses in leases to increase the incidence of uncompensated injury and to discourage incentive for safety precautions which potential liability creates, there is a sound basis for declaring such exculpatory clauses to be contrary to public policy-\nPetition for rehearing denied June 11, 1970.",

    "Lummi Indian Nation v. State",
    "Chambers, J.\n\u00b61 In 1998, this court held that under then-existing law, new private water rights did not fully vest until the water was put to a beneficial use, and not merely when the \u201c \u2018pumps and pipes\u2019 \u201d capacity to use the water was built. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582, 586, 957 P.2d 1241 (1998). We cautioned then that we were not considering municipal water rights, which often receive separate treatment in water law. Id. at 594. In response to our opinion, the legislature amended the municipal water law, Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (SESSHB 1338), to, among other things, explicitly define certain nongovernmental water suppliers as municipal and to make that definition retroactive. We are now asked whether these amendments violate separation of powers or facially violate due process. We conclude they do not. We reverse in part and affirm in part.\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b62 The beneficial and wise use of water has been a public concern since before we achieved statehood. Code of 1881, ch. 191, at 434; Ellis v. Pomeroy Improvement Co., 1 Wash. 572, 577-78, 21 P. 27 (1889) (discussing territorial water law). By 1891, our legislature was regulating water, Laws of 1891, ch. 142, at 327, and by 1917, our legislature had declared that\nsubject to existing rights all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto, or to the use thereof, shall be hereafter acquired only by appropriation for a beneficial use and in the manner provided and not otherwise; and, as between appropriations, the first in time shall be the first in right.\nLaws of 1917, ch. 117, \u00a7 1 (currently codified as RCW 90.03.010). The beneficial use of waters is a priority in our state; our state constitution itself specifically provides that \u201c[t]he use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\u201d Wash. Const, art. XXI, \u00a7 1. In partial implementation of that principle, water rights can be lost if they are not used, in whole or in part, for five or more years. RCW 90.14.160-.180. Water rights can also be lost if they are abandoned. Okanogan Wilderness League, Inc. v. Town of Twisp, 133 Wn.2d 769, 781, 947 P.2d 732 (1997). However, municipal water supply rights (among many others) are not subject to relinquishment. RCW 90.14.140(2)(d).\n\u00b63 Like most Western states, Washington regulates \u201cthe acquisition of appropriative rights to the use of public waters and ... the distribution of water to those entitled to receive it.\u201d 1 Wells A. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 7 (1971). Generally speaking, there is no private right to own the waters that flow across Washington State. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 583, 38 P. 147 (1894). Instead, a private right to use water can be acquired, and water can be owned once it is diverted for that use. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 590-91, 21 P. 314 (1889) (citing Lower Kings River Water Ditch Co. v. Kings River & Fresno Canal Co., 60 Cal. 408 (1882)); Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 118 Wn.2d 761, 767, 827 P.2d 275 (1992) (citing Madison v. McNeal, 171 Wash. 669, 674, 19 P.2d 97 (1933)). As a learned treatise summarizes it:\nThe appropriative right does not extend to ownership of the corpus of water while it remains in the natural source of supply. It is a right to the use of the water \u2014 a usufruct. Inherent in the right of appropriation are the requirements that the use made of the appropriated water shall be a beneficial one, and that the right to divert and use the water extends only to the quantity actually applied to such beneficial use. The appropriative right, therefore, is not merely a right to the use of the water; it is a right of beneficial use. This is the view that the courts have taken through the years, probably without significant dissent.\n1 Hutchins, supra, at 440.\n\u00b64 While the details have changed over the years, generally, our regulatory scheme has sought to balance vigorous beneficial use of the State\u2019s waters without impairing existing uses. To that end, Washington has a multistep procedure before new water rights can be acquired. While the details will vary depending on whether the applicant seeks to appropriate surface water or groundwater, among other things, the would-be user first submits an application to the Department of Ecology. RCW 90.03.250; see also ch. 90.44 RCW (groundwater). The department may give the applicant a temporary permit to use water while the application is being evaluated. RCW 90.03.250; see also RCW 90.03.260, .290. Second, once the application is complete, the department directs the applicant to publish notice in a paper of general circulation. RCW 90.03.280. Meanwhile, the department determines \u201cwhat water, if any, is available ... and find[s] and determine^] to what beneficial use or uses it can be applied.\u201d RCW 90.03.290(1). Fourth, if the department is satisfied that water is available and the proposed use is a beneficial use, it issues a permit specifying the amounts of water that can be taken and the beneficial uses to which that water may be applied. RCW 90.03-.290(3). A water right permit represents only an inchoate right, which does not become choate until the water right is perfected. RCW 90.03.330; Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589-90; Ellis, 1 Wash, at 577. Before the right is perfected, the applicant has only\n\u201can incomplete appropriative right in good standing. It comes into being as the first step provided by law for acquiring an appropriative right is taken. It remains in good standing so long as the requirements of law are being fulfilled. And it matures into an appropriative right on completion of the last step provided by law.\u201d\nTheodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 596 (quoting 1 Hutchins, supra, at 226). Permits can be extended for good cause shown, and permits can be canceled if their terms are violated. RCW 90.03.320. Water rights can also be obtained by condemnation. RCW 90.03.040.\n\u00b65 Once the water right is perfected, a water right certificate is issued. RCW 90.03.330. This certificate relates back to the time of application, so long as the rights were perfected with reasonable diligence. RCW 90.03.340; Avery v. Johnson, 59 Wash. 332, 335, 109 P. 1028 (1910). Given that the rights of junior water rights holders are subordinate to earlier rights holders, RCW 90.03.010, and given that water is an increasingly scarce resource, that relation back has significant value. Once rights are perfected, the point of diversion, the use, and the ownership of those rights may be changed or transferred, though only to the extent the water right has been historically put to beneficial use and other rights holders are not harmed. RCW 90.03.380(1); Okanogan Wilderness, 133 Wn.2d at 777-78; see also R.D. Merrill Co. v. Pollution Control Hearings Bd., 137 Wn.2d 118, 128-29, 969 P.2d 458 (1999); 1 Hutchins, supra, at 633-34 (noting that with some exceptions, place of use may not be changed without administrative consent). At the time of Theodoratus, disputes about water rights were first taken to the Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB). E.g., Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589; see also former RCW 43.21B.110 (1998). After Theodoratus, the legislature directed that water rights claimants file a petition with the Department of Ecology that could be referred directly to the superior court or proceed under the Administrative Procedure Act. Ch. 34.05 RCW; RCW 90.03.110; see also 23 Timothy Butler & Matthew King, Washington Practice: Environmental Law and Practice \u00a7 8.50, at 335 (2007). At oral argument, counsel for the State also suggested that other rights holders harmed by changes had a tort remedy.\n\u00b66 Until recently, it was not entirely clear what it took to perfect a water right. Early case law indicates that rights were not perfected until the water was both appropriated and put to beneficial use. See, e.g., Ortel v. Stone, 119 Wash. 500, 503, 205 P. 1055 (1922) (\u201cThe measure of their rights by appropriation is the amount of water which they have actually taken and put to a beneficial use.\u201d). However, at least since the 1950s, it seems the Department of Ecology and its predecessor were willing to issue permits and certificates based upon need and capacity rather than the actual beneficial use of the water. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 587. The approach of establishing water rights upon the capacity of the system enjoys the descriptive term of art \u201cpumps and pipes.\u201d Uneasiness developed among Washington\u2019s water users as different administrations of the Department of Ecology dealt differently with application of the statutory term \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d The tension between the application of the \u201cbeneficial use\u201d and the \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standards came to a head with this court\u2019s decision in Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582.\n\u00b67 George Theodoratus was a developer whose development progressed slowly over decades, apparently struggling to overcome litigation and economic downturns during the 1970s and 1980s. Id. at 587-88. Theodoratus received several extensions of the water permit for his development. Id. The last extension included the condition that his vested water rights would be based upon the actual water put to beneficial use rather than the development\u2019s water system\u2019s capacity. Id. at 588. Theodoratus appealed the actual beneficial use condition, perhaps because he had platted 253 lots, built a water system for 93 houses, and built 28 houses, none of which were, as far as we know, actually receiving water. Id. at 587,608 (Sanders, J., dissenting). We examined the current statutes in light of common law and recent court decisions. We concluded that the statutory scheme codified fundamental Western water law and required that actual beneficial use must occur before a water right certificate may issue. Id. at 592, 595. In short, we concluded that the Department of Ecology had not been following the statute when it vested water rights based upon system capacity instead of actual beneficial use of water. We cautioned, however, that we were not considering \u201cissues concerning municipal water suppliers\u201d and noted that \u201cthe statutory scheme allows for differences between municipal and other water use.\u201d Id. at 594. At that time, \u201cmunicipal water supply\u201d was not defined in chapter 90.03 RCW and the State acknowledges that there were no promulgated rules or policy guides defining \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d prior to the 2003 amendments. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t State of Wash, at 40. On occasion, private water supply companies were deemed municipal, but the department also took the position that private water associations were not entitled to be treated as municipal water suppliers. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 825-31 (Ga. Manor Water Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, Wash. Pollution Control Hrg\u2019s Bd. No. 93-68 (Order Granting Partial Summ. J. (Nov. 9, 1994))).\n\u00b68 Our Theodoratus decision caused concern among existing water users about the vitality of their existing water rights based on capacity. Apparently some water users were further unnerved by a draft policy floated by the Department of Ecology, but never adopted, which would have required all water rights based upon capacity to comply with the actual beneficial use requirement. The legislature responded to these uncertainties in 2003 by significantly amending the water law act. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338. Among other things, the 2003 amendments defined \u201cmunicipal water supplier\u201d and \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d for the first time, defined when \u201cplace of use\u201d could be the same as a municipal water supplier\u2019s service area, established that municipal water rights were not limited to the number of subscribers, and required specific conservation practices and planning. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338; see also H.B. Rep. on Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, at 1-2, 58th Leg., 1st Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (listing purposes of enacted bill). The bill also declared that \u201cwater right certificate [s] issued prior to September 9, 2003 for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015\u201d based on system capacity were rights in good standing. Laws op 2003,1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 6(3) (codified as RCW 90.03.330(3)). However, \u201c[a]fter September 9, 2003, the department must issue a new certificate under subsection (1) of this section for a water right represented by a water right permit only for the perfected portion of a water right as demonstrated through actual beneficial use of water.\u201d RCW 90.03.330(4). The legislation essentially put the legislature\u2019s imprimatur on our holding in Theodoratus prospectively while confirming the good standing of water certificates issued under the former system. 23 Butler & King, supra, \u00a7 8.11, at 293.\n\u00b69 In 2006, two groups of challengers sued, contending that several sections of the 2003 amendments were unconstitutional. The two cases were consolidated, and the trial court agreed with the challengers that the amendments to the definition of municipal water suppliers in RCW 90.03.015 and the retroactivity provision of RCW 90.03.330 violated separation of powers as, the court concluded, they effectively overruled Theodoratus. The trial court declined to reach the substantive due process challenges to those three provisions. The judge rejected the remaining facial procedural and substantive due process challenges. We granted review on the motion of all parties.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b610 The challenges before us are facial constitutional challenges to the statutes. \u201cWe presume statutes are constitutional and review challenges to them de novo.\u201d City of Seattle v. Ludvigsen, 162 Wn.2d 660, 668, 174 P.3d 43 (2007) (citing State v. Shultz, 138 Wn.2d 638, 642-43, 980 P.2d 1265 (1999)). \u201cConstruction of the state constitution is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d State v. Pugh, 167 Wn.2d 825, 835, 225 P.3d 892 (2009) (citing State v. Chenoweth, 160 Wn.2d 454, 462, 158 P.3d 595 (2007)); accord City of Kennewick v. Benton County, 131 Wn.2d 768, 771, 935 P.2d 606 (1997).\n\u00b611 We note that many of the arguments before us might be better raised in an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge.\nAn \u201cas applied\u201d challenge occurs where a plaintiff contends that a statute\u2019s application in the context of the plaintiff\u2019s actions or proposed actions is unconstitutional. If a statute is held unconstitutional as applied, it cannot be applied in the future in a similar context, but it is not rendered completely inoperative. A statute is rendered completely inoperative if it is declared facially unconstitutional. However, a facial challenge must be rejected if there are any circumstances where the statute can constitutionally be applied.\nWash. State Republican Party v. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, 141 Wn.2d 245, 282 n.14, 4 P.3d 808 (2000) (citing Ire re Det. of Turay, 139 Wn.2d 379, 417 n.28, 986 P.2d 790 (1999)). However, in this case, the challenges are explicitly facial.\n1. Separation of Powers and Statutory Amendments\n\u00b612 The challengers contend, successfully below, that RCW 90.03.015(3), (4), and RCW 90.03.330(3) facially violate separation of powers because they unsettle a decision of this court retroactively. Specifically, they challenge the 2003 amendments in which the legislature defined municipal water suppliers broadly to include private developers whose projects would provide water to more than 15 houses, RCW 90.03.015(3), (4); provided that under certain circumstances, a municipality\u2019s water rights would not be limited to the specified number of service connections or stated population so long as the change is \u201cconsistent with the approved water system plan\u201d among other things, RCW 90.03.260(4), (5); largely made existing water certificates based upon system capacity valid and limited the situations where the Department of Ecology could seek to invalidate a water rights certificate, RCW 90.03.330(2), (3); authorized municipal water suppliers, under certain circumstances, to shift place of use within the boundaries of approved water plans without consulting the Department of Ecology or notifying other water rights\u2019 holders, RCW 90.03.386(2); and allowed existing water rights certificates that would now be considered to be for municipal water services to be so amended, RCW 90.03.560. They contend that these provisions change the requirements noted in Theodoratus for private water rights to vest. They claim that the amendments to RCW 90.03.015(3) and (4) define municipal water suppliers so broadly that Theodoratus would now himself qualify as a municipal water supplier. Further, they note that RCW 90.03.330(3) provides that municipal water suppliers who had water rights certificates issued under the former \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standard had \u201cright [s] in good standing\u201d even if those rights would not have vested under Theodoratus. See also CP at 617. The State acknowledges that these amendments have some retroactive effect. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t at 36.\n113 We examined our separation of powers jurisprudence recently in Hale v. Wellpinit School District No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). Previously, in McClarty v. Totem Electric, 157 Wn.2d 214, 228, 137 P.3d 844 (2006), we rejected the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d promulgated by the Human Rights Commission in favor of the federal statutory definition. The legislature responded by, for the first time, legislatively defining disability consistent with the Human Rights Commission\u2019s earlier attempt, and made that definition retroactive to all claims that accrued prior to McClarty (as well as, of course, all claims accruing after the effective date of the statute). Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 498. We upheld the retroactive provision against a separation of powers claim.\n\u00b614 In Hale, we began by recognizing the presumption against retroactive application of a statute and the policy behind that presumption. Id. at 507-08. Retroactive application of a statute may violate the ex post facto doctrine, id. at 507 (citing State v. Schmidt, 143 Wn.2d 658, 672-73, 23 P.3d 462 (2001)), or affect vested rights and violate due process, id. (citing State v. Varga, 151 Wn.2d 179, 195, 86 P.3d 139 (2004)). Retroactive changes in the law alter the status quo in the law upon which people should be able to reasonably rely. Id. Retroactive amendments to the law may violate separation of powers by disturbing judgments, interfering with judicial functions, or cause manifest injustice. Thus, as we observed:\nThe presumption against retroactive application of a statute or amendment \u201c \u2018is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual citizen.\u2019 \u201d [State v.] Cruz, 139 Wn.2d [186,] 190[, 985 P.2d 384 (1999)] (quoting Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 439, 117 S. Ct. 891, 137 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1997)). This presumption \u201c \u2018is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.\u2019 \u201d Cruz, 139 Wn.2d at 190 (quoting Lynce, 519 U.S. at 439).\nState v. Smith, 144 Wn.2d 665, 673, 30 P.3d 1245, 39 P.3d 294 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), superseded by statute, Laws of 2002, ch. 107, as recognized in Varga, 151 Wn.2d at 183.\n\u00b615 In Hale, we said that in order to decide whether the retroactive application of a statute violates separation of powers we must determine \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether the activity of one branch threatens the independence or integrity or invades the prerogatives of another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 507 (quoting Carrick v. Locke, 125 Wn.2d 129, 135, 882 P.2d 173 (1994) (quoting Zylstra v. Piva, 85 Wn.2d 743, 750, 539 P.2d 823 (1975))).

            "text": "Chambers, J.\n\u00b61 In 1998, this court held that under then-existing law, new private water rights did not fully vest until the water was put to a beneficial use, and not merely when the \u201c \u2018pumps and pipes\u2019 \u201d capacity to use the water was built. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582, 586, 957 P.2d 1241 (1998). We cautioned then that we were not considering municipal water rights, which often receive separate treatment in water law. Id. at 594. In response to our opinion, the legislature amended the municipal water law, Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (SESSHB 1338), to, among other things, explicitly define certain nongovernmental water suppliers as municipal and to make that definition retroactive. We are now asked whether these amendments violate separation of powers or facially violate due process. We conclude they do not. We reverse in part and affirm in part.\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b62 The beneficial and wise use of water has been a public concern since before we achieved statehood. Code of 1881, ch. 191, at 434; Ellis v. Pomeroy Improvement Co., 1 Wash. 572, 577-78, 21 P. 27 (1889) (discussing territorial water law). By 1891, our legislature was regulating water, Laws of 1891, ch. 142, at 327, and by 1917, our legislature had declared that\nsubject to existing rights all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto, or to the use thereof, shall be hereafter acquired only by appropriation for a beneficial use and in the manner provided and not otherwise; and, as between appropriations, the first in time shall be the first in right.\nLaws of 1917, ch. 117, \u00a7 1 (currently codified as RCW 90.03.010). The beneficial use of waters is a priority in our state; our state constitution itself specifically provides that \u201c[t]he use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\u201d Wash. Const, art. XXI, \u00a7 1. In partial implementation of that principle, water rights can be lost if they are not used, in whole or in part, for five or more years. RCW 90.14.160-.180. Water rights can also be lost if they are abandoned. Okanogan Wilderness League, Inc. v. Town of Twisp, 133 Wn.2d 769, 781, 947 P.2d 732 (1997). However, municipal water supply rights (among many others) are not subject to relinquishment. RCW 90.14.140(2)(d).\n\u00b63 Like most Western states, Washington regulates \u201cthe acquisition of appropriative rights to the use of public waters and ... the distribution of water to those entitled to receive it.\u201d 1 Wells A. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 7 (1971). Generally speaking, there is no private right to own the waters that flow across Washington State. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 583, 38 P. 147 (1894). Instead, a private right to use water can be acquired, and water can be owned once it is diverted for that use. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 590-91, 21 P. 314 (1889) (citing Lower Kings River Water Ditch Co. v. Kings River & Fresno Canal Co., 60 Cal. 408 (1882)); Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 118 Wn.2d 761, 767, 827 P.2d 275 (1992) (citing Madison v. McNeal, 171 Wash. 669, 674, 19 P.2d 97 (1933)). As a learned treatise summarizes it:\nThe appropriative right does not extend to ownership of the corpus of water while it remains in the natural source of supply. It is a right to the use of the water \u2014 a usufruct. Inherent in the right of appropriation are the requirements that the use made of the appropriated water shall be a beneficial one, and that the right to divert and use the water extends only to the quantity actually applied to such beneficial use. The appropriative right, therefore, is not merely a right to the use of the water; it is a right of beneficial use. This is the view that the courts have taken through the years, probably without significant dissent.\n1 Hutchins, supra, at 440.\n\u00b64 While the details have changed over the years, generally, our regulatory scheme has sought to balance vigorous beneficial use of the State\u2019s waters without impairing existing uses. To that end, Washington has a multistep procedure before new water rights can be acquired. While the details will vary depending on whether the applicant seeks to appropriate surface water or groundwater, among other things, the would-be user first submits an application to the Department of Ecology. RCW 90.03.250; see also ch. 90.44 RCW (groundwater). The department may give the applicant a temporary permit to use water while the application is being evaluated. RCW 90.03.250; see also RCW 90.03.260, .290. Second, once the application is complete, the department directs the applicant to publish notice in a paper of general circulation. RCW 90.03.280. Meanwhile, the department determines \u201cwhat water, if any, is available ... and find[s] and determine^] to what beneficial use or uses it can be applied.\u201d RCW 90.03.290(1). Fourth, if the department is satisfied that water is available and the proposed use is a beneficial use, it issues a permit specifying the amounts of water that can be taken and the beneficial uses to which that water may be applied. RCW 90.03-.290(3). A water right permit represents only an inchoate right, which does not become choate until the water right is perfected. RCW 90.03.330; Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589-90; Ellis, 1 Wash, at 577. Before the right is perfected, the applicant has only\n\u201can incomplete appropriative right in good standing. It comes into being as the first step provided by law for acquiring an appropriative right is taken. It remains in good standing so long as the requirements of law are being fulfilled. And it matures into an appropriative right on completion of the last step provided by law.\u201d\nTheodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 596 (quoting 1 Hutchins, supra, at 226). Permits can be extended for good cause shown, and permits can be canceled if their terms are violated. RCW 90.03.320. Water rights can also be obtained by condemnation. RCW 90.03.040.\n\u00b65 Once the water right is perfected, a water right certificate is issued. RCW 90.03.330. This certificate relates back to the time of application, so long as the rights were perfected with reasonable diligence. RCW 90.03.340; Avery v. Johnson, 59 Wash. 332, 335, 109 P. 1028 (1910). Given that the rights of junior water rights holders are subordinate to earlier rights holders, RCW 90.03.010, and given that water is an increasingly scarce resource, that relation back has significant value. Once rights are perfected, the point of diversion, the use, and the ownership of those rights may be changed or transferred, though only to the extent the water right has been historically put to beneficial use and other rights holders are not harmed. RCW 90.03.380(1); Okanogan Wilderness, 133 Wn.2d at 777-78; see also R.D. Merrill Co. v. Pollution Control Hearings Bd., 137 Wn.2d 118, 128-29, 969 P.2d 458 (1999); 1 Hutchins, supra, at 633-34 (noting that with some exceptions, place of use may not be changed without administrative consent). At the time of Theodoratus, disputes about water rights were first taken to the Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB). E.g., Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589; see also former RCW 43.21B.110 (1998). After Theodoratus, the legislature directed that water rights claimants file a petition with the Department of Ecology that could be referred directly to the superior court or proceed under the Administrative Procedure Act. Ch. 34.05 RCW; RCW 90.03.110; see also 23 Timothy Butler & Matthew King, Washington Practice: Environmental Law and Practice \u00a7 8.50, at 335 (2007). At oral argument, counsel for the State also suggested that other rights holders harmed by changes had a tort remedy.\n\u00b66 Until recently, it was not entirely clear what it took to perfect a water right. Early case law indicates that rights were not perfected until the water was both appropriated and put to beneficial use. See, e.g., Ortel v. Stone, 119 Wash. 500, 503, 205 P. 1055 (1922) (\u201cThe measure of their rights by appropriation is the amount of water which they have actually taken and put to a beneficial use.\u201d). However, at least since the 1950s, it seems the Department of Ecology and its predecessor were willing to issue permits and certificates based upon need and capacity rather than the actual beneficial use of the water. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 587. The approach of establishing water rights upon the capacity of the system enjoys the descriptive term of art \u201cpumps and pipes.\u201d Uneasiness developed among Washington\u2019s water users as different administrations of the Department of Ecology dealt differently with application of the statutory term \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d The tension between the application of the \u201cbeneficial use\u201d and the \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standards came to a head with this court\u2019s decision in Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582.\n\u00b67 George Theodoratus was a developer whose development progressed slowly over decades, apparently struggling to overcome litigation and economic downturns during the 1970s and 1980s. Id. at 587-88. Theodoratus received several extensions of the water permit for his development. Id. The last extension included the condition that his vested water rights would be based upon the actual water put to beneficial use rather than the development\u2019s water system\u2019s capacity. Id. at 588. Theodoratus appealed the actual beneficial use condition, perhaps because he had platted 253 lots, built a water system for 93 houses, and built 28 houses, none of which were, as far as we know, actually receiving water. Id. at 587,608 (Sanders, J., dissenting). We examined the current statutes in light of common law and recent court decisions. We concluded that the statutory scheme codified fundamental Western water law and required that actual beneficial use must occur before a water right certificate may issue. Id. at 592, 595. In short, we concluded that the Department of Ecology had not been following the statute when it vested water rights based upon system capacity instead of actual beneficial use of water. We cautioned, however, that we were not considering \u201cissues concerning municipal water suppliers\u201d and noted that \u201cthe statutory scheme allows for differences between municipal and other water use.\u201d Id. at 594. At that time, \u201cmunicipal water supply\u201d was not defined in chapter 90.03 RCW and the State acknowledges that there were no promulgated rules or policy guides defining \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d prior to the 2003 amendments. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t State of Wash, at 40. On occasion, private water supply companies were deemed municipal, but the department also took the position that private water associations were not entitled to be treated as municipal water suppliers. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 825-31 (Ga. Manor Water Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, Wash. Pollution Control Hrg\u2019s Bd. No. 93-68 (Order Granting Partial Summ. J. (Nov. 9, 1994))).\n\u00b68 Our Theodoratus decision caused concern among existing water users about the vitality of their existing water rights based on capacity. Apparently some water users were further unnerved by a draft policy floated by the Department of Ecology, but never adopted, which would have required all water rights based upon capacity to comply with the actual beneficial use requirement. The legislature responded to these uncertainties in 2003 by significantly amending the water law act. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338. Among other things, the 2003 amendments defined \u201cmunicipal water supplier\u201d and \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d for the first time, defined when \u201cplace of use\u201d could be the same as a municipal water supplier\u2019s service area, established that municipal water rights were not limited to the number of subscribers, and required specific conservation practices and planning. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338; see also H.B. Rep. on Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, at 1-2, 58th Leg., 1st Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (listing purposes of enacted bill). The bill also declared that \u201cwater right certificate [s] issued prior to September 9, 2003 for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015\u201d based on system capacity were rights in good standing. Laws op 2003,1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 6(3) (codified as RCW 90.03.330(3)). However, \u201c[a]fter September 9, 2003, the department must issue a new certificate under subsection (1) of this section for a water right represented by a water right permit only for the perfected portion of a water right as demonstrated through actual beneficial use of water.\u201d RCW 90.03.330(4). The legislation essentially put the legislature\u2019s imprimatur on our holding in Theodoratus prospectively while confirming the good standing of water certificates issued under the former system. 23 Butler & King, supra, \u00a7 8.11, at 293.\n\u00b69 In 2006, two groups of challengers sued, contending that several sections of the 2003 amendments were unconstitutional. The two cases were consolidated, and the trial court agreed with the challengers that the amendments to the definition of municipal water suppliers in RCW 90.03.015 and the retroactivity provision of RCW 90.03.330 violated separation of powers as, the court concluded, they effectively overruled Theodoratus. The trial court declined to reach the substantive due process challenges to those three provisions. The judge rejected the remaining facial procedural and substantive due process challenges. We granted review on the motion of all parties.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b610 The challenges before us are facial constitutional challenges to the statutes. \u201cWe presume statutes are constitutional and review challenges to them de novo.\u201d City of Seattle v. Ludvigsen, 162 Wn.2d 660, 668, 174 P.3d 43 (2007) (citing State v. Shultz, 138 Wn.2d 638, 642-43, 980 P.2d 1265 (1999)). \u201cConstruction of the state constitution is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d State v. Pugh, 167 Wn.2d 825, 835, 225 P.3d 892 (2009) (citing State v. Chenoweth, 160 Wn.2d 454, 462, 158 P.3d 595 (2007)); accord City of Kennewick v. Benton County, 131 Wn.2d 768, 771, 935 P.2d 606 (1997).\n\u00b611 We note that many of the arguments before us might be better raised in an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge.\nAn \u201cas applied\u201d challenge occurs where a plaintiff contends that a statute\u2019s application in the context of the plaintiff\u2019s actions or proposed actions is unconstitutional. If a statute is held unconstitutional as applied, it cannot be applied in the future in a similar context, but it is not rendered completely inoperative. A statute is rendered completely inoperative if it is declared facially unconstitutional. However, a facial challenge must be rejected if there are any circumstances where the statute can constitutionally be applied.\nWash. State Republican Party v. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, 141 Wn.2d 245, 282 n.14, 4 P.3d 808 (2000) (citing Ire re Det. of Turay, 139 Wn.2d 379, 417 n.28, 986 P.2d 790 (1999)). However, in this case, the challenges are explicitly facial.\n1. Separation of Powers and Statutory Amendments\n\u00b612 The challengers contend, successfully below, that RCW 90.03.015(3), (4), and RCW 90.03.330(3) facially violate separation of powers because they unsettle a decision of this court retroactively. Specifically, they challenge the 2003 amendments in which the legislature defined municipal water suppliers broadly to include private developers whose projects would provide water to more than 15 houses, RCW 90.03.015(3), (4); provided that under certain circumstances, a municipality\u2019s water rights would not be limited to the specified number of service connections or stated population so long as the change is \u201cconsistent with the approved water system plan\u201d among other things, RCW 90.03.260(4), (5); largely made existing water certificates based upon system capacity valid and limited the situations where the Department of Ecology could seek to invalidate a water rights certificate, RCW 90.03.330(2), (3); authorized municipal water suppliers, under certain circumstances, to shift place of use within the boundaries of approved water plans without consulting the Department of Ecology or notifying other water rights\u2019 holders, RCW 90.03.386(2); and allowed existing water rights certificates that would now be considered to be for municipal water services to be so amended, RCW 90.03.560. They contend that these provisions change the requirements noted in Theodoratus for private water rights to vest. They claim that the amendments to RCW 90.03.015(3) and (4) define municipal water suppliers so broadly that Theodoratus would now himself qualify as a municipal water supplier. Further, they note that RCW 90.03.330(3) provides that municipal water suppliers who had water rights certificates issued under the former \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standard had \u201cright [s] in good standing\u201d even if those rights would not have vested under Theodoratus. See also CP at 617. The State acknowledges that these amendments have some retroactive effect. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t at 36.\n113 We examined our separation of powers jurisprudence recently in Hale v. Wellpinit School District No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). Previously, in McClarty v. Totem Electric, 157 Wn.2d 214, 228, 137 P.3d 844 (2006), we rejected the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d promulgated by the Human Rights Commission in favor of the federal statutory definition. The legislature responded by, for the first time, legislatively defining disability consistent with the Human Rights Commission\u2019s earlier attempt, and made that definition retroactive to all claims that accrued prior to McClarty (as well as, of course, all claims accruing after the effective date of the statute). Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 498. We upheld the retroactive provision against a separation of powers claim.\n\u00b614 In Hale, we began by recognizing the presumption against retroactive application of a statute and the policy behind that presumption. Id. at 507-08. Retroactive application of a statute may violate the ex post facto doctrine, id. at 507 (citing State v. Schmidt, 143 Wn.2d 658, 672-73, 23 P.3d 462 (2001)), or affect vested rights and violate due process, id. (citing State v. Varga, 151 Wn.2d 179, 195, 86 P.3d 139 (2004)). Retroactive changes in the law alter the status quo in the law upon which people should be able to reasonably rely. Id. Retroactive amendments to the law may violate separation of powers by disturbing judgments, interfering with judicial functions, or cause manifest injustice. Thus, as we observed:\nThe presumption against retroactive application of a statute or amendment \u201c \u2018is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual citizen.\u2019 \u201d [State v.] Cruz, 139 Wn.2d [186,] 190[, 985 P.2d 384 (1999)] (quoting Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 439, 117 S. Ct. 891, 137 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1997)). This presumption \u201c \u2018is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.\u2019 \u201d Cruz, 139 Wn.2d at 190 (quoting Lynce, 519 U.S. at 439).\nState v. Smith, 144 Wn.2d 665, 673, 30 P.3d 1245, 39 P.3d 294 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), superseded by statute, Laws of 2002, ch. 107, as recognized in Varga, 151 Wn.2d at 183.\n\u00b615 In Hale, we said that in order to decide whether the retroactive application of a statute violates separation of powers we must determine \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether the activity of one branch threatens the independence or integrity or invades the prerogatives of another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 507 (quoting Carrick v. Locke, 125 Wn.2d 129, 135, 882 P.2d 173 (1994) (quoting Zylstra v. Piva, 85 Wn.2d 743, 750, 539 P.2d 823 (1975))). We suggested that legislative intervention to affect the rights of parties in a particular case would overstep the legislative function. Id. at 509-10. Retroactive legislation that interferes with vested rights established by judicial rulings interferes with a judicial function or results in manifest injustice or threatens the independence, integrity, or prerogatives of the judicial branch may violate separation of powers. Id. at 507-08.\n\u00b616 However, in Hale, we also firmly rejected the contention that just because an appellate court\u2019s statutory interpretation relates back to the time the statute was originally adopted, any retroactive amendment of that statute violates separation of powers. Id. at 506; see also In re Pers. Restraint of Stewart, 115 Wn. App. 319, 75 P.3d 521 (2003). Indeed, it is wholly within the sphere of authority of the legislative branch to make policy, to pass laws, and to amend laws already in effect. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 509. Courts must exercise care not to invade the prerogatives of the legislative branch lest the judicial branch itself violate the doctrine of separation of powers. Coequal branches must respect one another\u2019s independence. In re Salary of Juvenile Dir., 87 Wn.2d 232, 238, 243, 552 P.2d 163 (1976) (citing William B. Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers: An Analysis of the Doctrine From Its Origin to the Adoption of the United States Constitution 110 (1965)); see also Carrick, 125 Wn.2d at 135.\n\u00b617 Applying these principles to this case, there is no general separation of powers violation caused by the amendments to RCW 90.03.015(3) and (4) and RCW 90.03.330(3). The legislature approached its legislative task both thoughtfully and with deference to this court\u2019s construction in Theodoratus. It adopted this court\u2019s holding prospectively, RCW 90.03.330(4); it evoked this court\u2019s language in stating that \u201cthe water right represented by a water right certificate issued prior to September 9,2003, for municipal supply purposes ... is a right in good standing,\u201d RCW 90.03.330(3); and it used the fact that this court did not consider \u201cissues concerning municipal water suppliers\u201d in Theodoratus as an opportunity to secure the rights of some existing water certificate holders, 135 Wn.2d at 594. The legislature made no attempt to apply the law to an existing set of facts, affect the rights of parties to the court\u2019s judgment, or interfere with any judicial function. Instead, the legislature allowed those who had planned their property development to rely upon the water rights previously approved by the statutorily authorized administrating agency. These amendments do not \u201cthreaten [ ] the independence or integrity\u201d of the judicial branch. Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 510. Instead, they work to amend an area of the law subject to ongoing legislative refinement in the face of changing conditions and, like in Hale, working in harmony with its coequal branch. We stress that Mr. Theodoratus is not a party before us and we leave for another day consideration of any as-applied challenges.\n2. Separation of Powers and Adjudication of Facts\n\u00b618 The trial court also found that \u201cRCW 90.03.330(3) violates the separation of powers under the state constitution because it purports to make a legislative determination of adjudicative facts concerning the \u2018good standing\u2019 of particular water rights.\u201d CP at 617-18. We disagree. Separation of powers is violated when the legislature oversteps its role and adjudicates facts. Justice Brachtenbach ably explored the difference between a legitimate exercise of legislative authority and a usurpation of the judicial fact finding role in City of Tacoma v. O\u2019Brien, 85 Wn.2d 266, 534 P.2d 114 (1975), a case examining a statute that made certain fuel contracts voidable in the face of skyrocketing oil prices. As we often find, we cannot improve on his words:\nAll these cases involve the element of adjudication, and we believe that a finding of \u201ceconomic impossibility\u201d is similarly adjudicatory. A legislature can declare that economic impossibility shall constitute, in the future, a defense in actions involving contractual disputes. A legislature can find that a worldwide shortage of petroleum exists. Finding that existing contracts, entered into at least 6 months prior to the legislation, have become economically impossible to perform, however, is a legal conclusion, a result which follows from examination and consideration of circumstances in a particular case and interpretation and application of legal principles to those facts. As Mr. Justice Holmes wrote in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210, 226, 53 L. Ed. 150, 29 S. Ct. 67 (1908);\nA judicial inquiry investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. That is its purpose and end. Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter ....\nO\u2019Brien, 85 Wn.2d at 272. Thus, when the legislature passes a statute premised on finding an adjudicative fact, it may violate separation of powers. But the legislature did not engage in any adjudication of facts. Rather, the relevant 2003 amendments simply confirmed that the right represented by a water right certificate issued before Theodoratus continued to be \u201ca right in good standing,\u201d RCW 90.03.330(3). Confirming existing rights was a legislative policy decision, not a factual adjudication.\n\u00b619 Of course, a statute is not constitutional simply because separation of powers is not offended. \u201cThe retroactive application of laws may violate the ex post facto doctrine, affect vested rights and violate due process, or affect other judicial functions.\u201d Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 507 (citations omitted) (citing Schmidt, 143 Wn.2d at 672-73; Varga, 151 Wn.2d at 195). But while RCW 90.03.330(3) removes the shadow from water certificates that might have been challenged under Theodoratus, this is a facial challenge to an exercise of general legislative authority.\n\u00b620 If any of those water rights were litigated and adjudicative facts developed, they are not in this case. Further, while it may be possible to construe \u201crights in good standing\u201d to mean that the legislature validated water rights that had been held invalid, the statute can also be construed to mean that such water rights will be treated like any other vested right represented by a water right certificate. We will give statutes constitutional constructions when possible. In re Pers. Restraint of Matteson, 142 Wn.2d 298, 307, 12 P.3d 585 (2000). Whether the application of the statute unconstitutionally unsettles a vested, judicially recognized right is better considered in a due process challenge. In this challenge, we are considering only unchallenged water rights. There is no encroachment on the judicial role that would offend separation of powers principles.\n3. Due Process\n\u00b621 We now turn to the facial due process challenges to the 2003 amendments. \u201c[Pjroperty owners have a vested interest in their water rights to the extent that the water is beneficially used on the land.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Adsit, 103 Wn.2d 698, 705, 694 P.2d 1065 (1985) (citing Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Acquavella, 100 Wn.2d 651, 655, 674 P.2d 160 (1983)). Vested water rights cannot be deprived without due process of law. Id. (citing Nielson v. Sponer, 46 Wash. 14, 89 P. 155 (1907)). Because junior rights holders take their water rights subject to the rights of senior rights holders, in times of scarcity the junior rights holders suffer first and suffer the most. Some junior rights holders will likely suffer (and others will likely benefit) because of these amendments. For example, for the first time, the legislature has defined municipal water supplier as anyone who provides water to 15 or more residences (among other things), and made that definition apply regardless of whether the water rights certificate was issued prior to September 2003. RCW 90.03.015, .330, .560. Municipal water suppliers are not subject to the risk of relinquishment as are most private water rights holders, and are subject to a different set of conditions before changing the place of use. RCW 90.14- . 140(2)(d) (relinquishment); RCW 90.03.380 (requiring individual water rights holders to apply to the department for permission to change place of use), .386(2) (allowing municipal water suppliers to change place of use within boundaries so long as it is consistent with an approved plan). While we take the State\u2019s point that even prior to the 2003 amendment, some private water supply companies had been deemed municipal, it is likely that there are junior water rights holders whose rights vested between Theodoratus and the 2003 amendments and whose enjoyment of their water rights will be detrimentally affected by these amendments. Reduced to its essence, the challengers contend that because of this likely detrimental effect on some rights holders, the 2003 amendments facially violate due process.\n\u00b622 We are not without sympathy to the challengers\u2019 contention that because of the amendments, some junior rights holders\u2019 enjoyment of their water rights may be impaired without individualized notice or prior opportunity to comment. But the challengers have cited no case, and we have found none, where mere potential impairment of some hypothetical person\u2019s enjoyment of a right has been held to be sufficient for a successful facial due process challenge. Nothing in these amendments changes the legal status of the group the challengers attempt to represent: junior water rights holders who take water subject to the rights of senior rights holders whose status may be improved by these changes. Instead, these amendments confirm what the department has already declared (that certain water rights are rights in good standing) and statutorily define something that had previously been statutorily undefined (the meaning of municipal water supplier). RCW 90.03.015, .260, .330, .386, .560. Of themselves, these changes to the law do not violate due process.\n\u00b623 Because this is a facial challenge, no case has been pleaded or proved where any individual rights holder\u2019s reasonable expectation of the enjoyment of water rights has actually been impaired or deprived in violation of due process of law. We note that several individuals have submitted declarations tending to show that since 2003, the amount and quality of the water they have been able to draw from their wells has deteriorated. The challengers suggest (but have not established) that this deterioration was caused by the 2003 amendments. We do not intend to minimize their loss. However, this is a facial challenge, and \u201ca facial challenge must be rejected if there are any circumstances where the statute can constitutionally be applied.\u201d Wash. State Republican Party, 141 Wn.2d at 282 n.14 (citing Turay, 139 Wn.2d at 417 n.28). This is not a standard the challengers have met.\n\u00b624 Junior rights holders always take their water rights subject to the risk that there may be no water to fulfill those rights. We agree with the trial court and the State that the increased likelihood that might happen to some unknown water rights holders is not a fatal facial due process fault in these amendments.\n\u00b625 The challengers specifically contend that the amendments to RCW 90.03.015 and .330 retroactively expand the water rights of municipalities by \u201cresurrecting\u201d water rights certificates issued before Theodoratus based on capacity. We disagree with their characterization of the impact of Theodoratus and the operation of the 2003 amendments. While Theodoratus may have changed the expectations of those who acquired water rights after the date it was issued, it did not automatically divest or invalidate any vested or perfected rights. Theodoratus himself simply sought judicial review of additional requirements the department imposed as a condition of an extension of time to perfect his own water rights. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 588. There was no party before the court with a perfected right under challenge, and thus we had no occasion to consider whether an erroneously perfected right would be invalidated by the department\u2019s mistaken practice of issuing certificates based on capacity rather than actual beneficial use. Nor do the amendments by themselves resurrect any relinquished rights. RCW 90.03.330(3) merely declares that water rights certificates issued prior to Theodoratus based on capacity are certificates in good standing. RCW 90.03.330(2) merely limits the power of the department to invalidate water rights certificates. RCW 90.03.015 is merely definitional. None of these statutes deprive junior water rights holders of vested property rights.\n\u00b626 The challengers cite several out of state cases for support. See San Carlos Apache Tribe v. Super. Ct. ex rel. County of Maricopa, 193 Ariz. 195, 972 P.2d 179 (1999); Fremont-Madison Irrigation Dist. & Mitigation Grp. v. Idaho Ground Water Appropriators, Inc., 129 Idaho 454, 926 P.2d 1301 (1996). San Carlos considered a statute that by its plain terms applied to perfected rights, changed the actual priorities of various rights holders, eliminated judicial review of certain factual findings in adjudications, and unconstitutionally denied courts the power to consider the public trust doctrine. San Carlos, 193 Ariz. at 204-06, 210, 215; see also generally Sean E. O\u2019Day, San Carlos Apache Tribe v. Super. Ct.: Rejecting Legislative Favoritism in Water Right Allocations, 4 U. Denv. Water L. Rev. 29 (2000). The amendments before us may impact the enjoyment of water rights of some junior water rights holders but do not by their terms change the legal rights or prioritization of water rights holders. Fremont-Madison considered the constitutionality of an amnesty statute that forgave noncompliance with certain statutory requirements for perfecting water rights. 129 Idaho at 457. While the court cautioned that enlargements of water rights to the detriment of those that had priority would be unconstitutional, it upheld the statute because it found sufficient protections against such enlargements. Id. at 461. But nothing in the amendments before us today themselves deprive any vested rights holder of any vested right as a matter of law.\n\u00b627 The challenges to RCW 90.03.386(2) suffer from a similar problem. RCW 90.03.386(2) says:\nThe effect of the department of health\u2019s approval of a planning or engineering document that describes a municipal water supplier\u2019s service area under chapter 43.20 RCW, or the local legislative authority\u2019s approval of service area boundaries in accordance with procedures adopted pursuant to chapter 70.116 RCW, is that the place of use of a surface water right or groundwater right used by the supplier includes any portion of the approved service area that was not previously within the place of use for the water right if the supplier is in compliance with the terms of the water system plan or small water system management program, including those regarding water conservation, and the alteration of the place of use is not inconsistent, regarding an area added to the place of use, with: Any comprehensive plans or development regulations adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW; any other applicable comprehensive plan, land use plan, or development regulation adopted by a city, town, or county; or any watershed plan approved under chapter 90.82 RCW, or a comprehensive watershed plan adopted under RCW 90.54.040(1) after September 9,2003, if such a watershed plan has been approved for the area.\n\u00b628 This provision was newly enacted in Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 5(2). In effect, it allows municipal water suppliers (which, again, now include many water rights holders who prior to 2003 might have been considered private) to change the place of use of water anywhere within their service system (the area where they provide water) upon the approval of the Department of Health or local legislative body and without Department of Ecology approval and process required for nonmunicipal water rights holders so long as the change is consistent with other local planning documents. Compare RCW 90.03.386(2), with RCW 90.03.380(1) (setting forth circumstances where notice and comment must be sought before water right can be changed). The challengers contend that this facially violates due process because changes might be approved by the Department of Health or local legislative body without notice or comment to other rights holders.\n\u00b629 But, like the due process challenges above, this is not a facial due process defect. Washington law still gives considerable process before any change can be made, and any impact on the rights of others will be at best collateral and indirect. See R.D. Merrill, 137 Wn.2d at 127 (department can approve changes to water rights only to the extent they are valid); RCW 90.44.100; RCW 90.03.380 (opportunity for review of system-capacity-based certificates); cf. City of Redmond v. Moore, 151 Wn.2d 664, 677, 91 P.3d 875 (2004) (statute that allowed the State to revoke drivers\u2019 licenses without an administrative hearing facially unconstitutional because it fails to give any process). Nothing in RCW 90.03.386(2) allows the vested rights of others to be unvested as a matter of law, and if a change in place of use does harm another water rights holder, that can be dealt with on a case by case basis. Further, it operates only prospectively. We affirm Judge Jim Rogers\u2019 conclusion that, as a facial matter, due process is not violated.\n\u00b630 Next, we turn to the specific due process challenges to RCW 90.03.260(4) and (5). These provisions say:\nAppropriation procedure \u2014 Application\u2014Contents\n(4) If for community or multiple domestic water supply, the application shall give the projected number of service connections sought to be served. However, for a municipal water supplier that has an approved water system plan under chapter 43.20 RCW or an approval from the department of health to serve a specified number of service connections, the service connection figure in the application or any subsequent water right document is not an attribute limiting exercise of the water right as long as the number of service connections to be served under the right is consistent with the approved water system plan or specified number.\n(5) If for municipal water supply the application shall give the present population to be served, and, as near as may be estimated, the future requirement of the municipality However, for a municipal water supplier that has an approved water system plan under chapter 43.20 RCW or an approval from the department of health to serve a specified number of service connections, the population figures in the application or any subsequent water right document are not an attribute limiting exercise of the water right as long as the population to be provided water under the right is consistent with the approved water system plan or specified number.\nThe challengers assert that these provisions are facially unconstitutional because they allow a municipal water supplier to increase the population served without providing other water rights holders notice or opportunity to be heard. While (4) is completely new, (5) simply requires that the municipality state its present water supply and anticipated future needs, see Laws op 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 4(4), (5); together, they do not facially undermine vested rights. First, their application is prospective; they apply only when an applicant seeks approval for a new permit or a change of an existing one. Second, they simply integrate such applications into existing water regulatory systems, including systems regulated by the Department of Health under chapter 43.20 RCW. Third, prior to the 2003 amendments, no provision of the water code that we have found or have had our attention drawn to limited municipal water suppliers to some maximum number of clients. Further, the Department of Health has long had the obligation to review and approve water plans to ensure adequacy for a given population. RCW 43.20.250, .260; WAC 246-290-100, -110. As a facial matter, the changes do not violate due process. Again, any impact on a private right is collateral and indirect. Cf. Moore, 151 Wn.2d at 677.\n\u00b631 We affirm the court below and find these provisions do not facially violate substantive or procedural due process.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b632 We affirm in part and reverse in part. We hold that these amendments do not violate the separation of powers doctrine. While nothing in this opinion should be taken to forestall a proper \u201cas applied\u201d challenge, the challengers have not shown that the risk that some junior rights holders\u2019 enjoyment of their rights will be impaired by operation of these amendments facially violates due process.\nMadsen, C.J., and C. Johnson, Alexander, Sanders, Owens, Fairhurst, J.M. Johnson, and Stephens, JJ, concur.\nSome of the parties have suggested that the court\u2019s conclusion that Theodoratus was not a municipality implies a holding that private parties could not be municipal water suppliers. Whether or not private parties could function as municipal water suppliers was not before the court. Theodoratus did contend that he was building a municipal water supply system. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 594. However, as the court noted, \u201c[H]is development [was] finite,\u201d \u00bf\u00bf\u00a1which is not a typical characteristic of a municipality. Municipalities are asked to estimate future needs, not merely apply for water to meet existing, finite needs. See, e.g., RCW 90.03.260(5); see generally ch. 43.20 RCW. We note in passing that there are many reasons arguments raised in the briefs may not be addressed in the opinion. The factual predicate may not appear in the record; the argument may not have been raised appropriately below; the issue may not have been properly raised in the petition or the answer; the court may simply feel it unnecessary to address them to reach a just adjudication. \u201cAn appellate court is not a performing bear, required to dance to each and every tune played on an appeal.\u201d State v. Waste Mgmt. of Wis., Inc., 81 Wis. 2d 555, 564, 261 N.W.2d 147 (1978).\nThe trial judge did not have the advantage of this court\u2019s decision in Hale v. Wellpinit School District No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009), which was issued after the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nThe order states that the trial court declined to reach the substantive due process challenge to RCW 90.03.300(3), not .330(3). However, .300 was not challenged and we suspect this was a scrivener\u2019s error.\nThe parties inform us that there is at least one \u201cas applied\u201d challenge currently pending before the Pollution Control Hearings Board. Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t Wash. State Univ. Opening Br. at 26-27 (citing Cornelius v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, No. 06-099 (Wash. Pollution Control Hr\u2019gs Bd.

This was a new provision of the 2003 amendments. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 1(3).\n\u201cMunicipal water supply purposes\u201d means a beneficial use of water: (a) For residential purposes through fifteen or more residential service connections or for providing residential use of water for a nonresidential population that is, on average, at least twenty-five people for at least sixty days a year; (b) for governmental or governmental proprietary purposes by a city, town, public utility district, county, sewer district, or water district; or (c) indirectly for the purposes in (a) or (b) of this subsection through the delivery of treated or raw water to a public water system for such use. If water is beneficially used under a water right for the purposes listed in (a), (b), or (c) of this subsection, any other beneficial use of water under the right generally associated with the use of water within a municipality is also for \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes,\u201d including, but not limited to, beneficial use for commercial, industrial, irrigation of parks and open spaces, institutional, landscaping, fire flow, water system maintenance and repair, or related purposes. If a governmental entity holds a water right that is for the purposes listed in (a), (b), or (c) of this subsection, its use of water or its delivery of water for any other beneficial use generally associated with the use of water within a municipality is also for \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes,\u201d including, but not limited to, beneficial use for commercial, industrial, irrigation of parks and open spaces, institutional, landscaping, fire flow, water system maintenance and repair, or related purposes.\nRCW 90.03.015(4). This was also a new provision of the 2003 amendments. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 1(4).\nThis subsection applies to the water right represented by a water right certificate issued prior to September 9, 2003, for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 where the certificate was issued based on an administrative policy for issuing such certificates once works for diverting or withdrawing and distributing water for municipal supply purposes were constructed rather than after the water had been placed to actual beneficial use. Such a water right is a right in good standing.\nRCW 90.03.330(3). This was a new provision of the 2003 amendments. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 6(3).\nWhen requested by a municipal water supplier or when processing a change or amendment to the right, the department shall amend the water right documents and related records to ensure that water rights that are for municipal water supply purposes, as defined in RCW 90.03.015, are correctly identified as being for municipal water supply purposes. This section authorizes a water right or portion of a water right held or acquired by a municipal water supplier that is for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 to be identified as being a water right for municipal water supply purposes. However, it does not authorize any other water right or other portion of a right held or acquired by a municipal water supplier to be so identified without the approval of a change or transfer of the right or portion of the right for such a purpose.\nRCW 90.03.560.\nCiting its own policy 2030, the State contends that even municipal water supply rights may be relinquished under certain circumstances when the water is not beneficially used for a sufficient period of time. Wash. State Dep\u2019t of Ecology, 2003 Municipal Water Law Interim Guidance and Policy Statement (GUID-2030). As it is not necessary for our disposition and as the parties are not meaningfully adverse on this subject, we do not consider whether this is so.\nThe challengers cite Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), for the due process standard. Mathews establishes a three-part test to determine what process is due before a right can be deprived. But here, the question is not about an administrative process that ends with the challenger\u2019s rights being confirmed or denied. The impact on the challenger\u2019s rights is occasional, collateral, and attenuated, and a rights holder has a vested interest in the legal status of other rights holders. We do not find Mathews helpful. Nor, given the inchoate and hypothetical nature of the potential injuries, do we find this a good case to explore the tension between the State\u2019s police power and the individual\u2019s due process rights.\nWashington Water Utilities Council challenges the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit evidence relevant to these assertions on the grounds that the evidence was not relevant to a facial constitutional challenge. We find no abuse of discretion.\nExcept as provided for the issuance of certificates under RCW 90.03.240 and for the issuance of certificates following the approval of a change, transfer, or amendment under RCW 90.03.380 or 90.44.100, the department shall not revoke or diminish a certificate for a surface or ground water right for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 unless the certificate was issued with ministerial errors or was obtained through misrepresentation. The department may adjust such a certificate under this subsection if ministerial errors are discovered, but only to the extent necessary to correct the ministerial errors. The department may diminish the right represented by such a certificate if the certificate was obtained through a misrepresentation on the part of the applicant or permit holder, but only to the extent of the misrepresentation. The authority provided by this subsection does not include revoking, diminishing, or adjusting a certificate based on any change in policy regarding the issuance of such certificates that has occurred since the certificate was issued. This subsection may not be construed as providing any authority to the department to revoke, diminish, or adjust any other water right.\nRCW 90.03.330(2).\nThe 2010 legislature passed, and the governor partially vetoed, a bill regarding water rights processing that touched on RCW 90.44.100 (among many other statutes). Laws of 2010, ch. 285. While the amendments do not appear directly relevant to our analysis, given that the parties have not had an opportunity to brief them, we pass no judgment upon them.",

    "Geise v. Lee",
    "Horowitz, J.\nPlaintiff, tenant of a mobile home park, appeals a judgment dismissing her claim based on defendants\u2019 alleged negligent failure to remove accumulated snow and ice from the common area in that park as a result of which she fell and was injured. The question raised concerns the duty of a mobile park owner in Washington to remove ice and snow accumulations from the common driveway area of the mobile home park under the landlord\u2019s control when the latter has not assumed that duty.\nLazy Wheels Mobile Home Park, located in Bothell, Washington, consists of approximately 100 spaces for mobile homes with a driveway between the rows of spaces for both pedestrian and vehicular use. No portion of the driveway is reserved for the exclusive use of either pedestrians or vehicles. Plaintiff, 61 years old, had been a tenant of the park since 1965. From January 23 to 26, 1972, a total of approximately 12 to 14 inches of snow accumulated on the common areas of the park. During the 6 days following January 26, alternately melting and freezing conditions, combined with passing vehicles, caused hummocks and ridges of ice from 4 to 6 inches in height to form throughout the common area of the park. On February 1, 1972, plaintiff, while carefully making her way to her sister\u2019s automobile, slipped and fell sustaining serious injuries. Defendant owners were aware of the dangerous accumulation and condition existing at the time. They had been directly informed thereof by the plaintiff on several occasions. Defendants\u2019 manager had also been notified of the condition. Other mobile home tenants had slipped and at least one other tenant required hospitalization as a result of her fall. Defendants at no time agreed to undertake, nor did they undertake, the removal of accumulated ice and snow. Plaintiff sued defendants for injuries she sustained by defendants negligently failing to remove the accumulated ice and snow. Defendants timely moved for summary judgment, supported by an affidavit stating:\nI am the owner and proprietor of the trailer park where Mrs. Geise rented a space. In the January-February snow of 1972,1 did not clean the street where she fell prior to her fall. I did not want to assume the responsibility of keeping the streets clear of snow and ice, and all the tenants knew it.\nThe court granted defendants\u2019 motion on the ground defendants had no duty to remove the accumulated ice and snow, having never undertaken the duty so to do. This appeal followed.\nThe relationship between a mobile park owner and an occupant of a space in that park, pursuant to mutual arrangements for that purpose, is one of landlord and tenant. Sunde v. Tollett, 2 Wn. App. 640, 469 P.2d 212, 41 A.L.R.3d 319 (1970). At common law one who leases a portion of his premises but retains control over the approaches, common passageways, stairways and other areas to be used in common by the owners and tenants, has a duty to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in safe condition for use of the tenant in his enjoyment of the demised premises. McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp., 79 Wn.2d 443, 486 P.2d 1093 (1971). The rule stated has long been followed in this state: Yarbrough v. Smith, 66 Wn.2d 365, 402 P.2d 667 (1965); Feigenbaum v. Brink, 66 Wn.2d 125, 401 P.2d 642 (1965); Anderson v: Reeder, 42 Wn.2d 45, 253 P.2d 423 (1953); Schedler v. Wagner, 37 Wn.2d 612, 225 P.2d 213, 230 P.2d 600, 26 A.L.R.2d 604 (1950); Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn.2d 340, 135 P.2d 459 (1943); Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 355 (1974).\nThe landlord\u2019s common-law duty with respect to common areas within his control is subject to several exceptions. See generally 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 109 (3d ed. 1939). One exception, known as the Massachusetts rule, adopted in a number of states including Washington, is that the landlord\u2019s duty does not extend to the removal of accumulations of ice and snow from the common areas unless the landlord has assumed the duty to do so. Schedler v. Wagner, supra; Oerter v. Ziegler, 59 Wash. 421, 109 P. 1058 (1910); Cramer v. Van Parys, 7 Wn. App. 584, 500 P.2d 1255 (1972). In Cramer the court approved the following jury instruction as a correct statement of the Washington law:\nYou are instructed that a landlord has no duty to remove accumulations of snow and ice from common passageways unless you find that the landlord has, in fact, assumed this duty. In the event you so find, then the defendant would be liable for injuries proximately caused by his failure to use reasonable care in the discharge of such duty, taking into consideration all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\nCramer at 590-91.\nWhen Oerter was decided in 1910, Massachusetts and some other states had already adopted the rule. Oerter states the rule it adopts represented the weight of authority, citing several cases, including Woods v. Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co., 134 Mass. 357, 45 Am. Rep. 344 (1883). Since Oerter, the Massachusetts rule has been followed in a number of cases, some fairly recent. Karp v. Mills, 348 Mass. 768, 202 N.E.2d 244 (1964); Kilbury v. McConnell, 246 Ark. 528, 438 S.W.2d 692 (1969). Some other states have refused to follow the Massachusetts rule, treating it as providing an illogical exception to the general duty of the landlord to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in his control in safe condition. Fuller v. Housing Authority, 108 R.I. 770, 279 A.2d 438, 49 A.L.R.3d 382 (1971); Dubreuil v. Dubreuil, 107 N.H. 519, 229 A.2d 338 (1967); Strong v. Shefveland, 249 Minn. 59, 81 N.W.2d 247 (1957). The New York cases have adopted an intermediate position. They hold that if the surface of the ice and snow on the common areas has formed into ridges or hummocks, then the landlord\u2019s duty of removal arises because the user is exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm. See Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387, 408-09 (1973). Neither Massachusetts nor Washington has adopted the New York rule, and Oerter, as noted, still expresses the Washington law. The cases supporting the respective rules discussed are collected in Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387 (1973).\nPlaintiff recognizes she cannot prevail on appeal unless the Oerter rule is overruled, the new rule to be applied to her case. She invites this court to do so. She relies upon the cases that have rejected the Massachusetts rule, adopting instead what is sometimes called the Connecticut rule, e.g., Fuller v. Housing Authority, supra. Text-writers support the latter rule. See 2 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts \u00a7 27.17, at 1516-17 (1956); W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 63, at 407 (4th ed. 1971). See 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 822 (1970); Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387, 400-04 (1973). In referring to the absence of a landlord\u2019s duty to remove ice and snow from common areas and the absence of any duty on the landlord\u2019s part to light common hallways, except under exceptional circumstances, 2 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts, at page 1517, states:\nBoth these rulings involve the fixing of arbitrary standards of care in a way that is disappearing generally throughout the field of negligence.\nAppellate courts, no doubt, have discretionary power to change or abandon prior legal doctrine and, to the extent necessary, to overrule prior decisions. As stated in State ex rel. Madden v. PUD No. 1, 83 Wn.2d 219, 221, 517 P.2d 585 (1973):\nThere is no vested right in an existing law \u2014 common law or statutory \u2014 which precludes its change or repeal.\nUnless the decision changing an existing rule holds otherwise, the change made in the opinion is retroactively applicable to the case in which the change is adopted. Some of the Washington cases illustrating retroactive overruling are set out in the margin.\nRetroactive overruling of an established rule may well result in substantial hardship to those who, in good faith, have relied on the rule. Such hardship may be minimized or largely eliminated if the overruling court has first suggested and thereby alerted the legal profession to the possibility the rule involved may be later reconsidered, e.g., K. Llewellyn, Common Law Tradition, Deciding Appeals 299-305 (1960). See Manion v. Pardee, 79 Wn.2d 1, 482 P.2d 767 (1971); Potts v. Amis, 62 Wn.2d 777, 787, 384 P.2d 825 (1963). A similar result may follow if, in the concerned state, there has been published from a responsible source a reasoned statement of dissatisfaction with the existing rule. Such publication may serve to put interested parties on notice the possibility of reconsideration is a real one and they should govern themselves accordingly.\nAn alternative method of obviating hardship to the concerned litigants resulting from their good faith reliance on the existing rule is to make the overruling prospective in operation, leaving the case under review to remain governed by the rule on which they have relied. State ex rel. Fin. Comm. v. Martin, 62 Wn.2d 645, 384 P.2d 833 (1963). See State v. Adams, 81 Wn.2d 468, 503 P.2d 111 (1972). Whether retroactive overruling should take place, whether hardship exists with respect to which a litigant should be protected, and what method of obviating hardship should be adopted, is determinable on a case by case basis as public interest may require.\nIn the instant case there is neither a showing nor argument the problem is so serious and the need for change so great and urgent that the 63-year-old Oerter rule must be immediately and retroactively overruled even though defendants apparently relied and based their defense thereon as they had a right to do. Thus, no published empirical study has been called to our attention and we know of none showing the doctrinal and economic consequences in this state of abandoning the Oerter rule in favor of either the Connecticut or New York rules. It is true the existence of the power to change or abandon a rule of law does not depend upon the existence of a supporting published study of how the rule works. Such information may or may not be obtainable. Appellate courts, however, are properly influenced by such a study if applicable to the concerned state \u2014 especially if the case law concerned with the rule is divided \u2014 when called upon to determine how to exercise their power. See State v. Reece, 79 Wn.2d 453, 486 P.2d 1088 (1971), refusing to abandon the M\u2019Naghteris rule in criminal insanity cases.\nSuch a study might show, for example, that during the years the Oerter rule has been in effect, the injuries in this state from unremoved ice and snow from common areas may have been so infrequent or minor as to make it unnecessary to risk the increase in rent that may result from adopting a more onerous rule of liability. On the other hand, if the uncompensated losses resulting from Oerter are a serious and continuing problem, then the abandonment of the Oerter rule in favor of either the Connecticut or New York rule may be justified regardless of possible increased costs that may ultimately have to be borne by tenants.\nAssuming arguendo the abandonment is desirable on doctrinal grounds, the lack of prior notice of possible reconsideration, the lack of sufficient relevant information from responsible sources concerning the desirability of change, the fact the Massachusetts rule followed in Oerter continues to receive support in cases arising since the Connecticut and New York rules have been adopted, argue against precipitous retroactive change or overruling. We are not here asked to make a ruling on a still open question in this state. We are asked to overrule long-established doctrine to which interested persons, including defendants, may well have adapted themselves as they had a right to do.\nThe case for justifiable reliance on the Oerter rule is buttressed by the fact there has been no prior published detailed criticism in this state of that rule that can fairly be said to have alerted the legal profession or interested persons in Washington that the Oerter rule could not safely be relied upon. The only published discussion of the rule in this state of which we are aware, aside from the court decisions noted, is Comment, Liability of Landlord and Tenant to Persons Injured on the Premises, 39 Wash. L. Rev. 345 (1964). The article contains a short discussion of the exception to the Oerter rule which imposes liability on a landlord if he has assumed the duty of removing ice and snow from common areas. The author suggests it should be sufficient to permit recovery by a tenant for the landlord\u2019s failure or refusal to remove ice and snow from common areas if the landlord has removed ice and snow in the past and the tenant has relied upon these past acts. The suggestion is then made, \u201c[i]f the court is unwilling to go this far, the removal of the \u2018natural condition\u2019 exception would be desirable.\u201d The suggestion, although very briefly argued, apparently was not intended as a complete discussion. There is no reference to or evaluation of the case law elsewhere, or of the economic need or consequences of abandoning the long-held Oerter rule; or the possible doctrinal consequences of abandonment with respect to other exceptions to the landlord\u2019s duty rule concerning common areas. See 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 109 (3d ed. 1939). It may be doubted if the suggestion, made in the manner described, would prevent justifiable reliance upon the Oerter rule. In fact, the Oerter rule was again followed about 8 months before plaintiff\u2019s accident by the trial court in Cramer v. Van Parys, its action being later affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\nWe believe the public interest will be better served if we do not act now on plaintiff\u2019s invitation to abandon the Oerter rule. At best the legal profession should be now alerted to the possibility the rule may have to be reconsidered when an appropriate opportunity arises to do so. See K.

            "text": "Horowitz, J.\nPlaintiff, tenant of a mobile home park, appeals a judgment dismissing her claim based on defendants\u2019 alleged negligent failure to remove accumulated snow and ice from the common area in that park as a result of which she fell and was injured. The question raised concerns the duty of a mobile park owner in Washington to remove ice and snow accumulations from the common driveway area of the mobile home park under the landlord\u2019s control when the latter has not assumed that duty.\nLazy Wheels Mobile Home Park, located in Bothell, Washington, consists of approximately 100 spaces for mobile homes with a driveway between the rows of spaces for both pedestrian and vehicular use. No portion of the driveway is reserved for the exclusive use of either pedestrians or vehicles. Plaintiff, 61 years old, had been a tenant of the park since 1965. From January 23 to 26, 1972, a total of approximately 12 to 14 inches of snow accumulated on the common areas of the park. During the 6 days following January 26, alternately melting and freezing conditions, combined with passing vehicles, caused hummocks and ridges of ice from 4 to 6 inches in height to form throughout the common area of the park. On February 1, 1972, plaintiff, while carefully making her way to her sister\u2019s automobile, slipped and fell sustaining serious injuries. Defendant owners were aware of the dangerous accumulation and condition existing at the time. They had been directly informed thereof by the plaintiff on several occasions. Defendants\u2019 manager had also been notified of the condition. Other mobile home tenants had slipped and at least one other tenant required hospitalization as a result of her fall. Defendants at no time agreed to undertake, nor did they undertake, the removal of accumulated ice and snow. Plaintiff sued defendants for injuries she sustained by defendants negligently failing to remove the accumulated ice and snow. Defendants timely moved for summary judgment, supported by an affidavit stating:\nI am the owner and proprietor of the trailer park where Mrs. Geise rented a space. In the January-February snow of 1972,1 did not clean the street where she fell prior to her fall. I did not want to assume the responsibility of keeping the streets clear of snow and ice, and all the tenants knew it.\nThe court granted defendants\u2019 motion on the ground defendants had no duty to remove the accumulated ice and snow, having never undertaken the duty so to do. This appeal followed.\nThe relationship between a mobile park owner and an occupant of a space in that park, pursuant to mutual arrangements for that purpose, is one of landlord and tenant. Sunde v. Tollett, 2 Wn. App. 640, 469 P.2d 212, 41 A.L.R.3d 319 (1970). At common law one who leases a portion of his premises but retains control over the approaches, common passageways, stairways and other areas to be used in common by the owners and tenants, has a duty to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in safe condition for use of the tenant in his enjoyment of the demised premises. McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp., 79 Wn.2d 443, 486 P.2d 1093 (1971). The rule stated has long been followed in this state: Yarbrough v. Smith, 66 Wn.2d 365, 402 P.2d 667 (1965); Feigenbaum v. Brink, 66 Wn.2d 125, 401 P.2d 642 (1965); Anderson v: Reeder, 42 Wn.2d 45, 253 P.2d 423 (1953); Schedler v. Wagner, 37 Wn.2d 612, 225 P.2d 213, 230 P.2d 600, 26 A.L.R.2d 604 (1950); Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn.2d 340, 135 P.2d 459 (1943); Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 355 (1974).\nThe landlord\u2019s common-law duty with respect to common areas within his control is subject to several exceptions. See generally 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 109 (3d ed. 1939). One exception, known as the Massachusetts rule, adopted in a number of states including Washington, is that the landlord\u2019s duty does not extend to the removal of accumulations of ice and snow from the common areas unless the landlord has assumed the duty to do so. Schedler v. Wagner, supra; Oerter v. Ziegler, 59 Wash. 421, 109 P. 1058 (1910); Cramer v. Van Parys, 7 Wn. App. 584, 500 P.2d 1255 (1972). In Cramer the court approved the following jury instruction as a correct statement of the Washington law:\nYou are instructed that a landlord has no duty to remove accumulations of snow and ice from common passageways unless you find that the landlord has, in fact, assumed this duty. In the event you so find, then the defendant would be liable for injuries proximately caused by his failure to use reasonable care in the discharge of such duty, taking into consideration all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\nCramer at 590-91.\nWhen Oerter was decided in 1910, Massachusetts and some other states had already adopted the rule. Oerter states the rule it adopts represented the weight of authority, citing several cases, including Woods v. Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co., 134 Mass. 357, 45 Am. Rep. 344 (1883). Since Oerter, the Massachusetts rule has been followed in a number of cases, some fairly recent. Karp v. Mills, 348 Mass. 768, 202 N.E.2d 244 (1964); Kilbury v. McConnell, 246 Ark. 528, 438 S.W.2d 692 (1969). Some other states have refused to follow the Massachusetts rule, treating it as providing an illogical exception to the general duty of the landlord to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in his control in safe condition. Fuller v. Housing Authority, 108 R.I. 770, 279 A.2d 438, 49 A.L.R.3d 382 (1971); Dubreuil v. Dubreuil, 107 N.H. 519, 229 A.2d 338 (1967); Strong v. Shefveland, 249 Minn. 59, 81 N.W.2d 247 (1957). The New York cases have adopted an intermediate position. They hold that if the surface of the ice and snow on the common areas has formed into ridges or hummocks, then the landlord\u2019s duty of removal arises because the user is exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm. See Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387, 408-09 (1973). Neither Massachusetts nor Washington has adopted the New York rule, and Oerter, as noted, still expresses the Washington law. The cases supporting the respective rules discussed are collected in Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387 (1973).\nPlaintiff recognizes she cannot prevail on appeal unless the Oerter rule is overruled, the new rule to be applied to her case. She invites this court to do so. She relies upon the cases that have rejected the Massachusetts rule, adopting instead what is sometimes called the Connecticut rule, e.g., Fuller v. Housing Authority, supra. Text-writers support the latter rule. See 2 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts \u00a7 27.17, at 1516-17 (1956); W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 63, at 407 (4th ed. 1971). See 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 822 (1970); Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387, 400-04 (1973). In referring to the absence of a landlord\u2019s duty to remove ice and snow from common areas and the absence of any duty on the landlord\u2019s part to light common hallways, except under exceptional circumstances, 2 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts, at page 1517, states:\nBoth these rulings involve the fixing of arbitrary standards of care in a way that is disappearing generally throughout the field of negligence.\nAppellate courts, no doubt, have discretionary power to change or abandon prior legal doctrine and, to the extent necessary, to overrule prior decisions. As stated in State ex rel. Madden v. PUD No. 1, 83 Wn.2d 219, 221, 517 P.2d 585 (1973):\nThere is no vested right in an existing law \u2014 common law or statutory \u2014 which precludes its change or repeal.\nUnless the decision changing an existing rule holds otherwise, the change made in the opinion is retroactively applicable to the case in which the change is adopted. Some of the Washington cases illustrating retroactive overruling are set out in the margin.\nRetroactive overruling of an established rule may well result in substantial hardship to those who, in good faith, have relied on the rule. Such hardship may be minimized or largely eliminated if the overruling court has first suggested and thereby alerted the legal profession to the possibility the rule involved may be later reconsidered, e.g., K. Llewellyn, Common Law Tradition, Deciding Appeals 299-305 (1960). See Manion v. Pardee, 79 Wn.2d 1, 482 P.2d 767 (1971); Potts v. Amis, 62 Wn.2d 777, 787, 384 P.2d 825 (1963). A similar result may follow if, in the concerned state, there has been published from a responsible source a reasoned statement of dissatisfaction with the existing rule. Such publication may serve to put interested parties on notice the possibility of reconsideration is a real one and they should govern themselves accordingly.\nAn alternative method of obviating hardship to the concerned litigants resulting from their good faith reliance on the existing rule is to make the overruling prospective in operation, leaving the case under review to remain governed by the rule on which they have relied. State ex rel. Fin. Comm. v. Martin, 62 Wn.2d 645, 384 P.2d 833 (1963). See State v. Adams, 81 Wn.2d 468, 503 P.2d 111 (1972). Whether retroactive overruling should take place, whether hardship exists with respect to which a litigant should be protected, and what method of obviating hardship should be adopted, is determinable on a case by case basis as public interest may require.\nIn the instant case there is neither a showing nor argument the problem is so serious and the need for change so great and urgent that the 63-year-old Oerter rule must be immediately and retroactively overruled even though defendants apparently relied and based their defense thereon as they had a right to do. Thus, no published empirical study has been called to our attention and we know of none showing the doctrinal and economic consequences in this state of abandoning the Oerter rule in favor of either the Connecticut or New York rules. It is true the existence of the power to change or abandon a rule of law does not depend upon the existence of a supporting published study of how the rule works. Such information may or may not be obtainable. Appellate courts, however, are properly influenced by such a study if applicable to the concerned state \u2014 especially if the case law concerned with the rule is divided \u2014 when called upon to determine how to exercise their power. See State v. Reece, 79 Wn.2d 453, 486 P.2d 1088 (1971), refusing to abandon the M\u2019Naghteris rule in criminal insanity cases.\nSuch a study might show, for example, that during the years the Oerter rule has been in effect, the injuries in this state from unremoved ice and snow from common areas may have been so infrequent or minor as to make it unnecessary to risk the increase in rent that may result from adopting a more onerous rule of liability. On the other hand, if the uncompensated losses resulting from Oerter are a serious and continuing problem, then the abandonment of the Oerter rule in favor of either the Connecticut or New York rule may be justified regardless of possible increased costs that may ultimately have to be borne by tenants.\nAssuming arguendo the abandonment is desirable on doctrinal grounds, the lack of prior notice of possible reconsideration, the lack of sufficient relevant information from responsible sources concerning the desirability of change, the fact the Massachusetts rule followed in Oerter continues to receive support in cases arising since the Connecticut and New York rules have been adopted, argue against precipitous retroactive change or overruling. We are not here asked to make a ruling on a still open question in this state. We are asked to overrule long-established doctrine to which interested persons, including defendants, may well have adapted themselves as they had a right to do.\nThe case for justifiable reliance on the Oerter rule is buttressed by the fact there has been no prior published detailed criticism in this state of that rule that can fairly be said to have alerted the legal profession or interested persons in Washington that the Oerter rule could not safely be relied upon. The only published discussion of the rule in this state of which we are aware, aside from the court decisions noted, is Comment, Liability of Landlord and Tenant to Persons Injured on the Premises, 39 Wash.

The suggestion is then made, \u201c[i]f the court is unwilling to go this far, the removal of the \u2018natural condition\u2019 exception would be desirable.\u201d The suggestion, although very briefly argued, apparently was not intended as a complete discussion. There is no reference to or evaluation of the case law elsewhere, or of the economic need or consequences of abandoning the long-held Oerter rule; or the possible doctrinal consequences of abandonment with respect to other exceptions to the landlord\u2019s duty rule concerning common areas. See 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 109 (3d ed. 1939). It may be doubted if the suggestion, made in the manner described, would prevent justifiable reliance upon the Oerter rule.

    "Puget Sound Service Corp. v. Dalarna Management Corp.",
    "Pekelis, J.\nPuget Sound Service Corporation appeals from the trial court's order granting summary judgment for Dalarna Management Corporation and dismissing Puget Sound's action for fraudulent concealment.\nI\nThe Union Harbor Apartments were built in 1970 on a pier over Lake Union. In 1974, the building was acquired by defendants/respondents Dalarna Management Corporation, Kearns Holdings, Ltd., and Pitard Holdings, Ltd. (Dalarna). Dalarna maintained the building through its agent, the Canamara Corporation, until 1980.\nDuring this period, Canamara employed Robert Hoover, first as resident manager of the Union Harbor Apartments and later as property manager overseeing various buildings, including the Union Harbor building. According to Hoover's deposition testimony, the Union Harbor building had problems with water leaks throughout the period of Dalarna's ownership. Hoover testified that there were leaks virtually every time it rained, and that at one time or another every unit in the building was affected. Furthermore, the leakage was obvious and was so well known by the residents of the building that it was, in Hoover's words, \"more or less a common joke.\"\nHoover further testified that during a 6-year period, various repairs were made in an attempt to stop the leaks. The roof was repaired, the windows were caulked, weather stripping was replaced, deflectors were put on the weep holes, and for a time the windows on one side of the building were completely sealed so that they could not be opened. Mr. Ullrich, Dalarna's property manager, was periodically apprised of the problem, as well as the various measures taken to correct it. Some of these measures ameliorated the problem somewhat, but none of them solved it. According to Hoover, neither he nor anyone else was ever able to determine the source of the problem.\nIn June 1980, the building was sold to Thomas Curran, who assigned it to plaintiff/appellant Puget Sound Service Corporation (Puget Sound). The original earnest money agreement, signed on February 14, 1980, provided that completion of the sale was conditioned upon the buyer's inspection of the building plans, the apartment records, and the building itself. Curran personally inspected the building several times, and he spoke with the building manager, Steve Frazier. In his deposition, Curran could not recall having asked Frazier about any defects or maintenance problems, nor could he recall Frazier having told him of any problems.\nCurran also had the building inspected on two occasions by William Tsao, a licensed professional engineer. In a report submitted after his second inspection, Tsao noted that he had observed evidence of water penetration, including stains, cracked plaster, and loose tiles. The report states:\nThese leaks are not serious but should be controlled by additional caulking outside and repainting and/or replas-tering inside. . . .\nIn his deposition testimony, Tsao stated that the evidence in question was readily observable. However, Tsao did not form an opinion as to the cause of the problem, since to do so would have been beyond the scope of his investigation.\nPuget Sound took ownership of the building and converted the apartments into condominiums. The water leaks continued. In March 1982, Nik Halladay, the president of Puget Sound, contacted Robert Hoover and asked for his advice. Hoover walked through the building with Halladay and explained the problems he had experienced during Dalarna's ownership of the building. Puget Sound made various repairs, but the problem persisted. By January 1986, according to Halladay, Puget Sound had spent approximately $118,000 in its attempts to stop the leaks.\nIn March 1983, Puget Sound brought suit against Dalarna, alleging that Dalarna had failed to disclose \"substantial, chronic, and unresolved water leakage problems\" of which it had been aware when it sold the building. In September 1984, Puget Sound also brought a third party complaint against Dalarna in a suit brought by the condominium owners' association against Puget Sound. The two actions were consolidated below.\nDalarna's motion for summary judgment was heard on March 23, 1987, and the court's order granting summary judgment was entered the same day. Puget Sound moved for reconsideration on March 27 and submitted two new affidavits with its motion. Dalarna argued that the affidavits were untimely, and urged the court not to consider them. The court declined to consider the two affidavits and denied Puget Sound's motion for reconsideration. Puget Sound brings this timely appeal from the court's orders.\nII\nOn appeal from an order of summary judgment, the reviewing court engages in the same inquiry as the trial court. Wilson v. Steinbach, 98 Wn.2d 434, 437, 656 P.2d 1030 (1982). A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CR 56(c). The court must consider all facts submitted and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and the motion should be granted only if, from all the evidence, reasonable persons could reach but one conclusion. Wilson, 98 Wn.2d at 437.\nIll\nPuget Sound contends that Dalarna's failure to disclose the extent of the leakage problem constitutes a constructive fraud by nondisclosure. Dalarna, on the other hand, argues that it had had no duty of disclosure because it allowed Puget Sound to inspect the building and because the leakage problem was apparent.\nAlthough there is no general requirement of full disclosure of all relevant facts in every business relationship, a duty to disclose can arise out of the general contractual obligation to deal in good faith. Liebergesell v. Evans, 93 Wn.2d 881, 893, 613 P.2d 1170 (1980). In Sorrell v. Young, 6 Wn. App. 220, 225, 491 P.2d 1312 (1971), this court set out a 3-part test for constructive fraud by nondisclosure in a case involving a landfill:\n(1) a vendor, knowing that the land has been filled, fails to disclose that fact to a purchaser of the property, and\n(2) the purchaser is unaware of the existence of the fill because either he has had no opportunity to inspect the property, or the existence of the fill was not apparent or readily ascertainable, and (3) the value of the property is materially affected by the existence of the fill. . . .\nThe dispositive issue presented here is whether Puget Sound is able to make a prima facie case under the second prong of the Sorrell test. Since it is undisputed that Puget Sound had ample opportunity to inspect the building, it must be shown that the defect complained of was neither apparent nor readily ascertainable. Whether Puget Sound can show this depends on how the \"defect\" is to be defined. It is undisputed that evidence of some water leakage was apparent. Therefore, if the defect is, as Dalarna contends, \"water leakage,\" then if follows that the defect was apparent.\nHowever, Puget Sound contends that the \"true defect\" at issue is not merely \"water leakage,\" but \"extreme, chronic water leakage.\" While it concedes that some water leakage was apparent, it argues that the extent of the leakage was so extreme as to constitute a defect qualitatively different from mere \"water leakage.\" This defect, Puget Sound argues, was neither apparent nor readily ascertainable. In essence, what Dalarna failed to disclose, according to Puget Sound's theory, was its \"historical experience\" with the leakage problem.\nThe cases on constructive fraud by nondisclosure do not directly address this issue. However, in cases where a constructive fraud has been found, there was no surface evidence of the defect. See Obde v. Schlemeyer, 56 Wn.2d 449, 453, 353 P.2d 672 (1960); Luxon v. Caviezel, 42 Wn. App. 261, 265, 710 P.2d 809 (1985); Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 221. In such cases, a constructive fraud can exist even though the buyer makes no inquiries which would lead him to ascertain the defect. See Obde, 56 Wn.2d at 451; Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 221.\nPuget Sound's argument that the extent of the problem can constitute a separate defect has a certain appeal. However, under the facts presented, this theory would require an improper extension of the doctrine of constructive fraud. Thus far, constructive fraud has been limited to situations where no evidence of the defect is apparent. As it presently exists, the law in Washington balances the harshness of the former rule of caveat emptor with the equally undesirable alternative of the courts standing in loco parentis to parties transacting business. See Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 223.\nEven accepting the distinction Puget Sound would make between the \"water leakage\" which was apparent and the \"extreme, chronic water leakage\" which was not, the \"true defect,\" as Puget Sound would have it, was closely related to the apparent surface problems. Since Puget Sound knew that there was some water leakage, it could readily have ascertained Dalarna's \"historical experience\" with the leakage by simply making inquiries. There is no evidence that such inquiries were made, or that they would have been fruitless.\nWe hold that where, as in this case, an actual inspection demonstrates some evidence of water penetration, the buyer must make inquiries of the seller. Through such questioning, the extent of the problem could have been readily ascertained. Under the circumstances of this case, the seller had no duty to affirmatively report its historical experience with water penetration problems.\nIV\nPuget Sound also contends that the trial court erred in failing to consider the two affidavits submitted in support of its motion for reconsideration. However, the result we have reached would not be affected by the two affidavits.\nOne of these affidavits relates to the materiality of the defect, an issue we need not reach. The other affidavit was intended to show that Tsao's conclusion that the leakage problem was not serious was reasonable under the circumstances. In light of our holding that the defect, water leakage, was apparent and that this relieved Dalarna of any duty to volunteer further information on the history of the defect, Tsao's affidavit is immaterial. It only confirms the fact that he had knowledge of the existence of the defect, knowledge which he conveyed to Puget Sound. Since the result would not have been affected by these affidavits, we need not determine whether the court's failure to consider them was error.\nAffirmed.\nSwanson and Webster, JJ., concur.\nReview denied by Supreme Court September 1, 1988.\nThe same test has since been applied to other types of latent defects. See Mitchell v. Straith, 40 Wn. App. 405, 409-13, 698 P.2d 609 (1985) (water pipes); Gunnar v. Brice, 17 Wn. App. 819, 822-23, 565 P.2d 1212 (1977) (construction defects); see also Obde v. Schlemeyer, 56 Wn.2d 449, 452-53, 353 P.2d 672 (1960) (termite infestation); Luxon v. Caviezel, 42 Wn. App. 261, 264-65, 710 P.2d 809 (1985) (septic system); Goldfarb v. Dietz, 8 Wn.

Puget Sound moved for reconsideration on March 27 and submitted two new affidavits with its motion. Dalarna argued that the affidavits were untimely, and urged the court not to consider them. The court declined to consider the two affidavits and denied Puget Sound's motion for reconsideration. Puget Sound brings this timely appeal from the court's orders.\nII\nOn appeal from an order of summary judgment, the reviewing court engages in the same inquiry as the trial court. Wilson v. Steinbach, 98 Wn.2d 434, 437, 656 P.2d 1030 (1982). A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CR 56(c). The court must consider all facts submitted and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and the motion should be granted only if, from all the evidence, reasonable persons could reach but one conclusion. Wilson, 98 Wn.2d at 437.\nIll\nPuget Sound contends that Dalarna's failure to disclose the extent of the leakage problem constitutes a constructive fraud by nondisclosure. Dalarna, on the other hand, argues that it had had no duty of disclosure because it allowed Puget Sound to inspect the building and because the leakage problem was apparent.\nAlthough there is no general requirement of full disclosure of all relevant facts in every business relationship, a duty to disclose can arise out of the general contractual obligation to deal in good faith. Liebergesell v. Evans, 93 Wn.2d 881, 893, 613 P.2d 1170 (1980). In Sorrell v. Young, 6 Wn. App. 220, 225, 491 P.2d 1312 (1971), this court set out a 3-part test for constructive fraud by nondisclosure in a case involving a landfill:\n(1) a vendor, knowing that the land has been filled, fails to disclose that fact to a purchaser of the property, and\n(2) the purchaser is unaware of the existence of the fill because either he has had no opportunity to inspect the property, or the existence of the fill was not apparent or readily ascertainable, and (3) the value of the property is materially affected by the existence of the fill. . . .\nThe dispositive issue presented here is whether Puget Sound is able to make a prima facie case under the second prong of the Sorrell test. Since it is undisputed that Puget Sound had ample opportunity to inspect the building, it must be shown that the defect complained of was neither apparent nor readily ascertainable. Whether Puget Sound can show this depends on how the \"defect\" is to be defined. It is undisputed that evidence of some water leakage was apparent. Therefore, if the defect is, as Dalarna contends, \"water leakage,\" then if follows that the defect was apparent.\nHowever, Puget Sound contends that the \"true defect\" at issue is not merely \"water leakage,\" but \"extreme, chronic water leakage.\" While it concedes that some water leakage was apparent, it argues that the extent of the leakage was so extreme as to constitute a defect qualitatively different from mere \"water leakage.\" This defect, Puget Sound argues, was neither apparent nor readily ascertainable. In essence, what Dalarna failed to disclose, according to Puget Sound's theory, was its \"historical experience\" with the leakage problem.\nThe cases on constructive fraud by nondisclosure do not directly address this issue. However, in cases where a constructive fraud has been found, there was no surface evidence of the defect. See Obde v. Schlemeyer, 56 Wn.2d 449, 453, 353 P.2d 672 (1960); Luxon v. Caviezel, 42 Wn. App. 261, 265, 710 P.2d 809 (1985); Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 221. In such cases, a constructive fraud can exist even though the buyer makes no inquiries which would lead him to ascertain the defect. See Obde, 56 Wn.2d at 451; Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 221.\nPuget Sound's argument that the extent of the problem can constitute a separate defect has a certain appeal. However, under the facts presented, this theory would require an improper extension of the doctrine of constructive fraud. Thus far, constructive fraud has been limited to situations where no evidence of the defect is apparent. As it presently exists, the law in Washington balances the harshness of the former rule of caveat emptor with the equally undesirable alternative of the courts standing in loco parentis to parties transacting business. See Sorrell, 6 Wn. App. at 223.\nEven accepting the distinction Puget Sound would make between the \"water leakage\" which was apparent and the \"extreme, chronic water leakage\" which was not, the \"true defect,\" as Puget Sound would have it, was closely related to the apparent surface problems. Since Puget Sound knew that there was some water leakage, it could readily have ascertained Dalarna's \"historical experience\" with the leakage by simply making inquiries. There is no evidence that such inquiries were made, or that they would have been fruitless.\nWe hold that where, as in this case, an actual inspection demonstrates some evidence of water penetration, the buyer must make inquiries of the seller. Through such questioning, the extent of the problem could have been readily ascertained. Under the circumstances of this case, the seller had no duty to affirmatively report its historical experience with water penetration problems.\nIV\nPuget Sound also contends that the trial court erred in failing to consider the two affidavits submitted in support of its motion for reconsideration. However, the result we have reached would not be affected by the two affidavits.\nOne of these affidavits relates to the materiality of the defect, an issue we need not reach. The other affidavit was intended to show that Tsao's conclusion that the leakage problem was not serious was reasonable under the circumstances. In light of our holding that the defect, water leakage, was apparent and that this relieved Dalarna of any duty to volunteer further information on the history of the defect, Tsao's affidavit is immaterial. It only confirms the fact that he had knowledge of the existence of the defect, knowledge which he conveyed to Puget Sound. Since the result would not have been affected by these affidavits, we need not determine whether the court's failure to consider them was error.\nAffirmed.\nSwanson and Webster, JJ., concur.\nReview denied by Supreme Court September 1, 1988.\nThe same test has since been applied to other types of latent defects. See Mitchell v. Straith, 40 Wn. App. 405, 409-13, 698 P.2d 609 (1985) (water pipes); Gunnar v. Brice, 17 Wn. App. 819, 822-23, 565 P.2d 1212 (1977) (construction defects); see also Obde v. Schlemeyer, 56 Wn.2d 449, 452-53, 353 P.2d 672 (1960) (termite infestation); Luxon v. Caviezel, 42 Wn. App. 261, 264-65, 710 P.2d 809 (1985) (septic system); Goldfarb v. Dietz, 8 Wn.

    "King County v. Boeing Co.",
    "Hamilton, J.\nPlaintiff, King County, appeals from a summary judgment granted in favor of defendants, The Boeing Company (hereafter referred to as Boeing) and Isaacson Iron Works (hereafter referred to as Isaacson).\nThe suit between the parties revolves about drainage of surface waters from the southerly portion of the King County Airport, also known as Boeing Field. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts. The parties disagree as to the governing legal principles.\nIn 1911, Commercial Waterway District No. 1 of King County (hereafter referred to as the district) was formed, pursuant to Laws of 1911, chapter 11, p. 11, RCW 91.04.010, et seq. The purpose of the district was to straighten, widen, and dredge the natural course of the Duwamish River, a navigable stream, which flowed northwesterly into Elliott Bay, and to make thereof a ship canal or man-made waterway. In 1913, the district began construction of the canal, which is now known as the Duwamish Waterway. At several points, this waterway intersected and followed the old or natural thread of the river, then left the course of the river in a straight line to the next point of intersection. About 1916, the waterway was completed and the river was diverted from its natural channel and has since flowed in the waterway. By reason of this diversion, substantial portions of the natural channel of the river were bypassed and abandoned, leaving a number of crescent or oxbow loops lying on both sides of the waterway, the title to which vested in the district. The abandoned portions of the river lying east of the waterway and west of East Marginal Way are referred to as \u201cslips\u201d. There are seven such slips, all of which now have been sold by the district. The abandoned portions of the river channel lying east of East Marginal Way, between Slips 4 and 5, were sold by the district to King County, filled, and now lie beneath the airport.\nThe following map portrays the area between Slips 4 and 5, including the waterway, the airport area, and the abandoned portions of the river lying east and west of East Marginal Way. The superimposed arrows indicate the original direction of the river\u2019s flow. All but 900 feet of Slip 5 has heretofore been filled.\nBefore and after construction of the waterway and the airport, surface waters drained naturally in a northerly and westerly direction. The present runways of the airport are at a grade of .38 per cent from south to north. Before and after construction, the waters of the river and the waterway were affected by the ebb and flow of the tides in Elliott Bay. When the tides are in, the unfilled portion of Slip 5 is flooded. When the tides go out, Slip 5 drains westerly into the waterway.\nIn 1943, the airport was owned and operated by the United States Government, during which time a drainage system was installed. By this system, the surface waters upon the southerly portion of the airport are collected in an elaborate system of underground pipe and catch basins, and then pumped, by a series of six pumps, westerly through a 4-foot drain pipe that runs beneath East Marginal Way, several railroad tracks, and some buildings located on property belonging to Isaacson. The terminus or outfall of this drain discharges the surface waters pumped through it into the remaining 900 feet of Slip 5, from whence it flows into the waterway.\nThis drainage system was constructed without the knowledge or consent of the district, which then owned Slip 5. In 1947, Isaacson granted a 12-foot easement over its property, conforming to the route of the existing drain pipe.\nThe United States Government sought an easement through Slip 5, which was refused by the district.\nIn 1956, the district sold Slip 5 to Isaacson and Boeing\u2019s predecessor. Isaacson now owns the northerly portion of Slip 5 and Boeing the southerly portion. Both Isaacson and Boeing own land adjacent to their respective portions of the slip.\nThe present dispute arose when Isaacson commenced filling its portion of Slip 5 with impervious material to bring it to the level of its adjacent property. It is undisputed that if Isaacson and Boeing fill Slip 5 the existing drainage system for the southerly portion of the airport will be blocked and, unless remedied, the airport flooded.\nIsaacson offers an easement through Slip 5 to permit extension by King County of its drain pipe.

Herein lies the core of the controversy: Who shall pay for extension of the drain pipe through Slip 5?\nKing County commenced this action, seeking to enjoin the filling of Slip 5. A temporary restraining order was issued ex parte. Issue was joined and a motion for summary judgment interposed. The trial court, upon the basis of the undisputed facts, as presented by the pleadings and affidavits submitted, concluded King County had no legal right to discharge surface waters from the airport into Slip 5, the property of Isaacson and Boeing, and dissolved the temporary restraining order.\nKing County, on appeal, makes five assignments of error, which by argument are reduced to two basic contentions: (a) Slip 5 is a natural water or drainage course, and (b) Isaacson and Boeing are estopped from interfering with or obstructing the existing drainage system.\nKing County\u2019s contentions must be considered against the backdrop of the following applicable principles, which we consider established by previous decisions of this court:\n(1) The bypassed and abandoned portions of the bed and shores of the Duwamish River ceased to be a part of the Duwamish river, waterway, or watercourse, and title thereto, with the power of alienation, vested in Commercial Waterway District No. 1.

(2d) 1379.\nKing County first contends that Slip 5 was originally and is presently a natural watercourse or drainway for properties lying east of East Marginal Way. Among the reasons asserted in support of this contention is that the flux and reflux of the tide caused waters within the old channel, and now causes waters within Slip 5, to flow both east and west.\nWe cannot agree with King County\u2019s contention for three reasons. First, it is undisputed that the natural current and flow of the original Duwamish River through that portion of its channel which is now known as Slip 5 was in an easterly direction. Second, the normal and natural drainage of surface waters from the properties lying east of East Marginal Way was originally and is presently north and northwesterly, rather than westerly toward Slip 5. And, third, the ebb and flow of the tides in either the Duwamish River, the Duwamish Waterway, or Slip 5, in nowise alters the natural drainage direction of surface waters from surrounding properties.\nIn short, absent consent of the proprietors, King County has no legal right to artificially collect and discharge surface waters upon or into Slip 5 in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, the natural flow of such surface waters.\nKing County next contends Isaacson and Boeing are estopped from interfering with or obstructing discharge of waters into Slip 5 from the existing drainage system. This contention is premised upon King County\u2019s assertion that (a) Commercial Waterway District No. 1, as common grantor of the abandoned portions of the Duwamish River channel, rendered necessary artificial drainage of the airport properties by construction of the Duwamish Waterway; (b) by its grant of an easement through its property, in 1947, Isaacson acquiesced and consented to the construction and maintenance of the artificial drainage system discharging into Slip 5; and (c) Boeing, through its predecessors in interest, including Commercial Waterway District No. 1, and Isaacson, as a tenant in common, is bound by the visible use and patent necessity of Slip 5 as a drainway.\nWe find no merit in King County\u2019s contention. It has cited no authority, and we have found none, erecting, by operation of law, an extension of an easement such as is here sought under the circumstances here present. The record is devoid of any fact from which it might be inferred that King County, or its predecessor in interest, the United States Government, relied upon the actions of Commercial Waterway District No. 1, the Isaacson grant of easement, or the conduct of Boeing, or its predecessors in interest, as according any easement beyond the outfall of the existing drainage system. In fact, the record indicates without dispute that King County\u2019s predecessor in interest frankly recognized the necessity for acquiring easement rights through Slip 5, and failed in its efforts to perfect such rights. We do not attribute to King County a lesser knowledge.\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nOtt, C. J., Donworth, Finley, and Weaver, JJ., concur.\nCommercial Waterway Dist.

            "text": "Hamilton, J.\nPlaintiff, King County, appeals from a summary judgment granted in favor of defendants, The Boeing Company (hereafter referred to as Boeing) and Isaacson Iron Works (hereafter referred to as Isaacson).\nThe suit between the parties revolves about drainage of surface waters from the southerly portion of the King County Airport, also known as Boeing Field. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts. The parties disagree as to the governing legal principles.\nIn 1911, Commercial Waterway District No. 1 of King County (hereafter referred to as the district) was formed, pursuant to Laws of 1911, chapter 11, p. 11, RCW 91.04.010, et seq. The purpose of the district was to straighten, widen, and dredge the natural course of the Duwamish River, a navigable stream, which flowed northwesterly into Elliott Bay, and to make thereof a ship canal or man-made waterway. In 1913, the district began construction of the canal, which is now known as the Duwamish Waterway. At several points, this waterway intersected and followed the old or natural thread of the river, then left the course of the river in a straight line to the next point of intersection. About 1916, the waterway was completed and the river was diverted from its natural channel and has since flowed in the waterway. By reason of this diversion, substantial portions of the natural channel of the river were bypassed and abandoned, leaving a number of crescent or oxbow loops lying on both sides of the waterway, the title to which vested in the district. The abandoned portions of the river lying east of the waterway and west of East Marginal Way are referred to as \u201cslips\u201d. There are seven such slips, all of which now have been sold by the district. The abandoned portions of the river channel lying east of East Marginal Way, between Slips 4 and 5, were sold by the district to King County, filled, and now lie beneath the airport.\nThe following map portrays the area between Slips 4 and 5, including the waterway, the airport area, and the abandoned portions of the river lying east and west of East Marginal Way. The superimposed arrows indicate the original direction of the river\u2019s flow. All but 900 feet of Slip 5 has heretofore been filled.\nBefore and after construction of the waterway and the airport, surface waters drained naturally in a northerly and westerly direction. The present runways of the airport are at a grade of .38 per cent from south to north. Before and after construction, the waters of the river and the waterway were affected by the ebb and flow of the tides in Elliott Bay. When the tides are in, the unfilled portion of Slip 5 is flooded. When the tides go out, Slip 5 drains westerly into the waterway.\nIn 1943, the airport was owned and operated by the United States Government, during which time a drainage system was installed. By this system, the surface waters upon the southerly portion of the airport are collected in an elaborate system of underground pipe and catch basins, and then pumped, by a series of six pumps, westerly through a 4-foot drain pipe that runs beneath East Marginal Way, several railroad tracks, and some buildings located on property belonging to Isaacson. The terminus or outfall of this drain discharges the surface waters pumped through it into the remaining 900 feet of Slip 5, from whence it flows into the waterway.\nThis drainage system was constructed without the knowledge or consent of the district, which then owned Slip 5. In 1947, Isaacson granted a 12-foot easement over its property, conforming to the route of the existing drain pipe.\nThe United States Government sought an easement through Slip 5, which was refused by the district.\nIn 1956, the district sold Slip 5 to Isaacson and Boeing\u2019s predecessor. Isaacson now owns the northerly portion of Slip 5 and Boeing the southerly portion. Both Isaacson and Boeing own land adjacent to their respective portions of the slip.\nThe present dispute arose when Isaacson commenced filling its portion of Slip 5 with impervious material to bring it to the level of its adjacent property. It is undisputed that if Isaacson and Boeing fill Slip 5 the existing drainage system for the southerly portion of the airport will be blocked and, unless remedied, the airport flooded.\nIsaacson offers an easement through Slip 5 to permit extension by King County of its drain pipe. King County consents to extension of its pipe by defendants. Herein lies the core of the controversy: Who shall pay for extension of the drain pipe through Slip 5?\nKing County commenced this action, seeking to enjoin the filling of Slip 5. A temporary restraining order was issued ex parte. Issue was joined and a motion for summary judgment interposed. The trial court, upon the basis of the undisputed facts, as presented by the pleadings and affidavits submitted, concluded King County had no legal right to discharge surface waters from the airport into Slip 5, the property of Isaacson and Boeing, and dissolved the temporary restraining order.\nKing County, on appeal, makes five assignments of error, which by argument are reduced to two basic contentions: (a) Slip 5 is a natural water or drainage course, and (b) Isaacson and Boeing are estopped from interfering with or obstructing the existing drainage system.\nKing County\u2019s contentions must be considered against the backdrop of the following applicable principles, which we consider established by previous decisions of this court:\n(1) The bypassed and abandoned portions of the bed and shores of the Duwamish River ceased to be a part of the Duwamish river, waterway, or watercourse, and title thereto, with the power of alienation, vested in Commercial Waterway District No. 1.

    "1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard Condominium Ass'n v. Apartment Sales Corp.",
    "Chambers, J.\n\u2014 The 1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard Condominium Association (homeowners) are the owners of three condominiums that were rendered uninhabitable when the soil underlying the property gave way precipitously during winter storms. The homeowners brought suit against several parties, including the City of Seattle (city). The homeowners argued the city should not have permitted the condominiums to be built due to the latent risk of soil movement, and that the city\u2019s storm drains had contributed to the slide. Before allowing the condominiums to be constructed, the city, concerned about the possibility of landslides, had imposed several conditions on the developer. These conditions included a covenant exculpating the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement. In this case, we are asked to determine whether an exculpatory covenant recorded in a deed runs with the land, and whether an action may be maintained against the city for alleged negligence in maintaining storm drains and granting permits. The trial court dismissed all claims against the city at summary judgment. The Court of Appeals agreed that the claims arising from permitting should be dismissed, but reinstated the claims arising from negligently maintained storm drains. We affirm the Court of Appeals dismissal of the negligent permitting claims (though on different grounds), affirm reinstatement of the claims relating to the storm drains, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nISSUES\n1. Does a covenant exculpating a city from liability for damages caused by soil movement run with the land?\n2. Does a city have a duty to homeowners (1) to refuse to grant a building permit when there is a known risk of significant soil movement; or (2) to exercise due care to maintain a public drain system?\nFACTS\nThis is the second case accepted for review by this Court (and the third where review was sought) arising out of the same unfortunate condominium project. These condominiums were built on a steep slope in between the city\u2019s Capitol Hill and Eastlake districts. The slope consists mostly of a permeable mixture of sand and fill resting on top of an impermeable mixture of silt and clay, a configuration that often leads to landslides.\nApartment Sales Corporation sought and received a permit from the city to build three townhouse condominiums on this site, 1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard. The site consisted of a small, flat area and a steep slope running down to a section of freeway. Because the sites were in a potential slide area, the developers were required to obtain several zoning variances.\nIn addition to the variances, the city imposed three specific conditions before it would grant building permits. First, the developers were required to inform all purchasers of the risk of soil movement. Second, continuous insurance was required. Third, the developers were required to grant and record a covenant releasing the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement, except for damages caused by the city\u2019s sole negligence. The covenant reads in relevant part:\nWHEREAS, the property is located in a \u201cpotential slide area\u201d as defined in City of Seattle Director\u2019s Rule 2-87,[] which rule requires as a condition of the issuance of land use and construction permits that this covenant be signed, acknowledged and recorded in the records of King County; NOW, THEREFORE, Owner(s) agree(s) as follows:\n1. Owner(s) will inform his/her successors and assigns of the property described in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d that the property is in a potential slide area, of the risks associated with development thereon, of any conditions or prohibitions on development imposed by the City, and of any features in this design which will require maintenance or modification to address anticipated soils changes.\n2. Owner(s) on his/her own behalf and on behalf of his/her heirs, successors and assigns hereby waives any right to assert any claim against the City for any loss, or damage to people or property either on or off the site resulting from soil movement by reason of or arising out of the issuance of the permit(s) by the City for development on this property except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City.\n3. Requirements for continuous insurance as required by the permit authorizing the development.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 44-45.\nThis covenant was referenced in the Preliminary Commitment for Title Insurance for the Fukuis, owners of 1515 Lakeview Boulevard. No documentation has been supplied on the other two units; however, the other homeowners do not dispute that it was properly recorded or that they had notice.\nThe homeowners received numerous assurances from the developers that the site was stable and the homes would not slip. The homeowners\u2019 complaint alleges they were assured the units would be safe, even if the soil slid away. Lakeview was flooded at least four times between November 1992 and November 1996. In each flood, at least a foot of water inundated the garages and basements of the units. Perhaps not coincidentally, the public storm drain system overflowed each time the condominiums flooded. The homeowners provided the declaration of an engineering geologist, Mackey Smith, which stated that failures of the city-maintained public drain system permitted thousands of gallons of water to inundate the condominiums. Smith also stated that these drain overflows were a contributing cause of the soil movement. There was other evidence of infrastructure failure: in November 1996 a city inspector discovered \u201cthe pipe leading from the manhole/catch basin of the former Lakeside Boulevard alignment had separated and was blocked. . . . This break was repaired.\u201d CP at 18.\nIn late December 1996, two severe storms dumped heavy snow onto soils already at or near saturation. Rain followed, saturating the snow because it could not penetrate frozen soil beneath. Then a warm rain quickly melted the saturated snow. Between December 30, 1996 and January 1, 1997 \u201ctemperatures rose rapidly and all of the snow was melted by intense warm air. The combination of saturated soil, freezing temperatures, and snow, followed by rapid thaw and warm rain, triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the Puget Sound region.\u201d CP at 265.\nAll three townhouses had been occupied about four years when the sites experienced significant soil movement. At approximately 6:00 a.m. on January 3, 1997, early rising homeowners in the Lakeview complex realized they had no running water. This was because the property had moved, breaking the connection with the water main. Water was \u201c \u2018bubbling out of the ground.\u2019 \u201d CP at 19. Within a day, the property had sunk between four and six feet and had moved west two feet. The homes were rendered uninhabitable.\nThe homeowners sued the city, the developers, the geotechnical engineer, the architect, the contractor, and the structural engineer. The homeowners settled with the developers, and this Court ultimately dismissed the claim against the builders based on the statute of limitations. 1519-1525 Lakeview Blvd. Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Apartment Sales Corp., 144 Wn.2d 570, 29 P.3d 1249 (2001). The city successfully moved for summary judgment based on the covenant, assumption of the risk, and the public duty doctrine. The homeowners appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. That court specifically found that the covenant did not run with the land, but found the negligent permitting claims were barred by the public duty doctrine. The Court of Appeals reinstated claims related to negligent maintenance of the storm drains. The city petitioned for review, which we granted.\nANALYSIS\nThis case is here on summary judgment presenting only questions of law. All questions will be reviewed de novo. Rivett v. City of Tacoma, 123 Wn.2d 573, 578, 870 P.2d 299 (1994).\nDoes the Exculpatory Language in the Deed Run With the Land?\nA. Sovereign Immunity\nWe must first decide whether the abolition of sovereign immunity, RCW 4.96.010, is violated when a local government requires, as a condition of granting a building permit, an exculpatory covenant tailored to alleviate specific concerns unique to a particular project. We hold that exculpatory covenants do not categorically violate sovereign immunity. However, blanket grants of immunity secured routinely for performance of public functions do not differ meaningfully from ordinances immunizing local governments for their own negligence, and will be invalidated under Rivett, 123 Wn.2d 573, and Employco Personnel Services, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 117 Wn.2d 606, 817 P.2d 1373 (1991). See also Howe v. Douglas County, 146 Wn.2d 183, 43 P.3d 1240 (2002). These issues will not be substantially revisited here.\nThe city contends innovative land use instruments, such as exculpatory covenants, should be encouraged because the Growth Management Act, chapter 36.70A RCW, is channeling development onto more and more marginal lots. The city is also concerned that if it denies building permits, it runs the risk of committing regulatory takings or inverse condemnation, as well as potentially frustrating the laudable goals of the Growth Management Act. The city argues that requiring the release and requiring the developers to have insurance and inform subsequent purchasers of the danger is a fair way to allow development. This argument suggests that property owners of land marginal for development because of the composition, topography, location, or other characteristic of the property should be free to propose creative solutions, and accept the risks of development.\nWe hold that a local government and a property owner may reach an arms-length, bargained-for agreement which may include waivers of liability for risks created by the proposed use of property because of the shape, composition, location or other characteristic unique to the property sought to be developed. Here we find that the exculpatory language of the covenant was tailored to the specific risks presented by the proposed development of the property and appropriately limited in scope to the danger of soil movement. Therefore it does not violate this State\u2019s abolition of sovereign immunity by functionally enacting blanket immunity.\nB. Enforceability of the Covenant against Successive Owners\nThe homeowners argue that this covenant may not be enforced against them on the theory exculpatory waivers do not \u201crun with the land\u201d and therefore cannot bind successors in interest. Accordingly, we turn now to the requirements for a covenant to run/\nCovenants are deeply rooted in our law, dating at least to the 14th century. Restatement (Third) of Prop: Servitudes, Introduction at 5 (2000). The seminal Spencer\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 72 (Q.B. 1583) established the general requirements. Spencer\u2019s Case involved a covenant by a tenant to build a wall. The tenant covenanted on behalf of himself and his executors, administrators, and assigns to build a brick wall on a leased lot. After executing the covenant, the tenant assigned the property to another. The new tenant refused to build the wall. \u2018Although there is some doubt from the report as to who won, the case is famous because the judges laid down three propositions about the running of the burden of covenants.\u201d Jesse Dukeminier & James E. Krier, Property 856 (3d ed. 1993). There must be intent to bind successors, the obligation must touch and concern the land, and there must be privity of estate. Id. Otherwise, the \u201ccovenant\u201d is merely a contract and will not bind future possessors of the land. William B. Stoebuck, Running Covenants: An Analytical Primer, 52 Wash. L. Rev. 861, 863-64 (1977). Through much of their history, the requirements for a covenant to run varied depending on whether it was \u201creal\u201d (developed and enforced in courts of law) or \u201cequitable\u201d (developed and enforced in the Chancery). However, the distinctions have largely vanished from our law. See Hollis v. Garwall, Inc., 137 Wn.2d 683, 690, 974 P.2d 836 (1999).\nGenerally, there are five elements required for a covenant to run:\n(1) a promise which is enforceable between the original parties;\n(2) which touches and concerns; (3) which the parties intended to bind successors; and (4) which is sought to be enforced by an original party or a successor, against an original party or a successor in possession; (5) who has notice of the covenant or has not given value.\nStoebuck, supra, at 909-10. Four of these elements are not seriously disputed by the parties before this Court. The issue before us is whether an exculpatory covenant touches and concerns the land.\nProfessor Stoebuck noted:\nIf there ever was a rule that a running covenant had to touch and concern land in a physical sense, it has long since been abandoned in America. The most that can be said concerning American doctrine is that the meaning of touch and concern tends to become less clear as physical contact becomes less direct.\nStoebuck, supra, at 870 (footnote omitted). This Court has not adopted a strict test for \u201ctouch and concern\u201d; instead, we have established an analytical approach:\n\u201c \u2018Generally speaking, a covenant touches or concerns the land if it is such as to benefit the grantor or the lessor, or the grantee or lessee, as the case may be. As the term implies, the covenant must concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land granted or demised and the liability to perform it, and the right to take advantage of it must pass to the assignee. Conversely, if the covenant does not touch or concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land, it is the collateral and personal obligation of the grantor or lessor and does not run with the land.\u2019 \u201d\nRodruck v. Sand Point Maint. Comm\u2019n, 48 Wn.2d 565, 574-75, 295 P.2d 714 (1956) (quoting City of Seattle v. Fender, 42 Wn.2d 213, 218, 254 P.2d 470 (1953) (quoting Pelser v. Gingold, 214 Minn. 281, 8 N.W.2d 36, 39 (1943))). It is an open question whether a covenant warning of risk and exculpating liability for that risk touches and concerns the land. The only court to reach whether such covenant would run held, without analysis of touch and concern, that it did run. Phillips v. Altman, 1966 OK 46, 412 P.2d 199 (holding that a covenant not to sue for damages arising from oil and gas pollution ran with the land and was not void as against public policy).\nThe city relies upon Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at 690 to support an argument that this Court has abandoned the requirement of \u201ctouch and concern.\u201d Hollis does not extend so far. Hollis was limited to mutual covenants in a subdivision. The requirements for covenants running in subdivisions have been relaxed compared to covenants running in other contexts; it is even possible for covenants to be enforced against those who have no covenant appearing on their title. See Stoebuck, supra, at 908-10; see also 17 William B. Stoebuck, Washington Practice, Real Estate: Property Law \u00a7 3.2, at 127-28 (1995). Further, this Court was not considering in Hollis generalized rules governing covenants; instead, the argument focused on whether the liberalized parole evidence rule of Berg v. Hudesman, 115 Wn.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222 (1990) applied to covenants. This Court has not relaxed the touch and concern requirement for the enforceability of covenants in settings other than subdivisions and we decline to do so now.\nWe conclude that this covenant satisfies the touch and concern doctrine as used in this State. Read as a whole, the covenant burdens the use of land, since the covenant is limited to the reasonable enjoyment of the land and limits rights normally associated with ownership. Further, few things touch and concern land more than the soil itself. This is sufficient to meet the requirements of Rodruck. The city is exculpated for losses that are not caused by the city\u2019s own negligence arising from soil movement, as reasonably contemplated by the parties to the covenant. Therefore, we hold that this covenant runs with the land.\nNEGLIGENCE\nA. Negligent Permitting Claim\nWhile not raised to this Court, given our disposition of the issues we will briefly address whether the city, when granting a permit to the developers, had a duty to future homeowners enforceable in tort. We hold it did not. Alleged negligent permitting alone cannot be the basis of a negligence claim against local government, absent a recognized exception. See Howe, 146 Wn.2d 183; Taylor v. Stevens County, 111 Wn.2d 159, 759 P.2d 447 (1988). Homeowners have not established that they fall within a recognized exception. Therefore, we affirm both the trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissal of this claim.\nB. City\u2019s Duty to Maintain Drainage System\nThe trial court dismissed the negligent maintenance claims against the city, finding they were barred by the public duty doctrine. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city on this claim. The Court of Appeals reversed.\nThe homeowners contend the city\u2019s storm drain system had been negligently maintained, and that negligence proximately caused the land to slide. They pleaded facts tending to show that they fall within the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine. To fall within the special relationship exception on their negligent maintenance claim, the homeowners must establish: \u201c(1) there is direct contact or privity between the public official and the injured plaintiff which sets the latter apart from the general public, and (2) there are express assurances given by a public official, which (3) gives rise to justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d Taylor, 111 Wn.2d at 166.\nThe homeowners also contend that negligent maintenance occurred both to the drainage system on the developed site and off of the developed site. According to the homeowners, the drainage system for the Lakeview property had two components: foundation drains channeling water from the foundation area into a storm sewer system, and lines conducting water from the downspouts off site. The homeowners submitted facts tending to show that the drainage system was built so that it was not tightly lined into the storm sewer system but connected to an infiltration gallery. Instead of taking the surface water away from the site, it introduced the water to the area of the foundation. The defective drainage system was apparently buried before it was inspected by a representative of the city.\nThe Fukuis filed a claim with the city for flood damage, and were compensated. Aware of the drainage problems, the city installed catch basins in front of the Fukui residence. Ms. Fukui submitted an affidavit saying she relied on assurances from the city that it would maintain the storm drains. She has demonstrated, sufficient to defeat a claim for summary judgment, direct contact, express assurances, and justifiable reliance. She falls within the special relationship exception with regards to damages occasioned by actual negligence in maintaining the storm drain system. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, we conclude the city is not liable for negligently granting a permit to build on this site. We also hold the exculpatory covenant is valid to the extent it releases the city from liability resulting from soil movement \u201cresulting from . . . the issuance of the permit.\u201d The covenant does not, and may not, exculpate the city for soil movement-related losses caused by the city\u2019s own negligence. The homeowners may pursue claims against the city arising out of negligent maintenance of the storm and water drain system. Accordingly, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nAlexander, C.J., and Smith, Johnson, Madsen, Sanders, Ireland, Bridge, and Owens, JJ., concur.\nNo argument about the constitutionality or legality of this rule was made at an",

City of Seattle, 117 Wn.2d 606, 817 P.2d 1373 (1991). See also Howe v. Douglas County, 146 Wn.2d 183, 43 P.3d 1240 (2002). These issues will not be substantially revisited here.\nThe city contends innovative land use instruments, such as exculpatory covenants, should be encouraged because the Growth Management Act, chapter 36.70A RCW, is channeling development onto more and more marginal lots. The city is also concerned that if it denies building permits, it runs the risk of committing regulatory takings or inverse condemnation, as well as potentially frustrating the laudable goals of the Growth Management Act. The city argues that requiring the release and requiring the developers to have insurance and inform subsequent purchasers of the danger is a fair way to allow development. This argument suggests that property owners of land marginal for development because of the composition, topography, location, or other characteristic of the property should be free to propose creative solutions, and accept the risks of development.\nWe hold that a local government and a property owner may reach an arms-length, bargained-for agreement which may include waivers of liability for risks created by the proposed use of property because of the shape, composition, location or other characteristic unique to the property sought to be developed. Here we find that the exculpatory language of the covenant was tailored to the specific risks presented by the proposed development of the property and appropriately limited in scope to the danger of soil movement. Therefore it does not violate this State\u2019s abolition of sovereign immunity by functionally enacting blanket immunity.\nB. Enforceability of the Covenant against Successive Owners\nThe homeowners argue that this covenant may not be enforced against them on the theory exculpatory waivers do not \u201crun with the land\u201d and therefore cannot bind successors in interest. Accordingly, we turn now to the requirements for a covenant to run/\nCovenants are deeply rooted in our law, dating at least to the 14th century. Restatement (Third) of Prop: Servitudes, Introduction at 5 (2000). The seminal Spencer\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 72 (Q.B. 1583) established the general requirements. Spencer\u2019s Case involved a covenant by a tenant to build a wall. The tenant covenanted on behalf of himself and his executors, administrators, and assigns to build a brick wall on a leased lot. After executing the covenant, the tenant assigned the property to another. The new tenant refused to build the wall. \u2018Although there is some doubt from the report as to who won, the case is famous because the judges laid down three propositions about the running of the burden of covenants.\u201d Jesse Dukeminier & James E. Krier, Property 856 (3d ed. 1993). There must be intent to bind successors, the obligation must touch and concern the land, and there must be privity of estate. Id. Otherwise, the \u201ccovenant\u201d is merely a contract and will not bind future possessors of the land. William B. Stoebuck, Running Covenants: An Analytical Primer, 52 Wash. L. Rev. 861, 863-64 (1977). Through much of their history, the requirements for a covenant to run varied depending on whether it was \u201creal\u201d (developed and enforced in courts of law) or \u201cequitable\u201d (developed and enforced in the Chancery). However, the distinctions have largely vanished from our law. See Hollis v. Garwall, Inc., 137 Wn.2d 683, 690, 974 P.2d 836 (1999).\nGenerally, there are five elements required for a covenant to run:\n(1) a promise which is enforceable between the original parties;\n(2) which touches and concerns; (3) which the parties intended to bind successors; and (4) which is sought to be enforced by an original party or a successor, against an original party or a successor in possession; (5) who has notice of the covenant or has not given value.\nStoebuck, supra, at 909-10. Four of these elements are not seriously disputed by the parties before this Court. The issue before us is whether an exculpatory covenant touches and concerns the land.\nProfessor Stoebuck noted:\nIf there ever was a rule that a running covenant had to touch and concern land in a physical sense, it has long since been abandoned in America. The most that can be said concerning American doctrine is that the meaning of touch and concern tends to become less clear as physical contact becomes less direct.\nStoebuck, supra, at 870 (footnote omitted). This Court has not adopted a strict test for \u201ctouch and concern\u201d; instead, we have established an analytical approach:\n\u201c \u2018Generally speaking, a covenant touches or concerns the land if it is such as to benefit the grantor or the lessor, or the grantee or lessee, as the case may be. As the term implies, the covenant must concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land granted or demised and the liability to perform it, and the right to take advantage of it must pass to the assignee. Conversely, if the covenant does not touch or concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land, it is the collateral and personal obligation of the grantor or lessor and does not run with the land.\u2019 \u201d\nRodruck v. Sand Point Maint. Comm\u2019n, 48 Wn.2d 565, 574-75, 295 P.2d 714 (1956) (quoting City of Seattle v. Fender, 42 Wn.2d 213, 218, 254 P.2d 470 (1953) (quoting Pelser v. Gingold, 214 Minn. 281, 8 N.W.2d 36, 39 (1943))). It is an open question whether a covenant warning of risk and exculpating liability for that risk touches and concerns the land. The only court to reach whether such covenant would run held, without analysis of touch and concern, that it did run. Phillips v. Altman, 1966 OK 46, 412 P.2d 199 (holding that a covenant not to sue for damages arising from oil and gas pollution ran with the land and was not void as against public policy).\nThe city relies upon Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at 690 to support an argument that this Court has abandoned the requirement of \u201ctouch and concern.\u201d Hollis does not extend so far. Hollis was limited to mutual covenants in a subdivision. The requirements for covenants running in subdivisions have been relaxed compared to covenants running in other contexts; it is even possible for covenants to be enforced against those who have no covenant appearing on their title. See Stoebuck, supra, at 908-10; see also 17 William B. Stoebuck, Washington Practice, Real Estate: Property Law \u00a7 3.2, at 127-28 (1995). Further, this Court was not considering in Hollis generalized rules governing covenants; instead, the argument focused on whether the liberalized parole evidence rule of Berg v. Hudesman, 115 Wn.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222 (1990) applied to covenants. This Court has not relaxed the touch and concern requirement for the enforceability of covenants in settings other than subdivisions and we decline to do so now.\nWe conclude that this covenant satisfies the touch and concern doctrine as used in this State. Read as a whole, the covenant burdens the use of land, since the covenant is limited to the reasonable enjoyment of the land and limits rights normally associated with ownership. Further, few things touch and concern land more than the soil itself. This is sufficient to meet the requirements of Rodruck. The city is exculpated for losses that are not caused by the city\u2019s own negligence arising from soil movement, as reasonably contemplated by the parties to the covenant. Therefore, we hold that this covenant runs with the land.\nNEGLIGENCE\nA. Negligent Permitting Claim\nWhile not raised to this Court, given our disposition of the issues we will briefly address whether the city, when granting a permit to the developers, had a duty to future homeowners enforceable in tort. We hold it did not. Alleged negligent permitting alone cannot be the basis of a negligence claim against local government, absent a recognized exception. See Howe, 146 Wn.2d 183; Taylor v. Stevens County, 111 Wn.2d 159, 759 P.2d 447 (1988). Homeowners have not established that they fall within a recognized exception. Therefore, we affirm both the trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissal of this claim.\nB. City\u2019s Duty to Maintain Drainage System\nThe trial court dismissed the negligent maintenance claims against the city, finding they were barred by the public duty doctrine. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city on this claim. The Court of Appeals reversed.\nThe homeowners contend the city\u2019s storm drain system had been negligently maintained, and that negligence proximately caused the land to slide. They pleaded facts tending to show that they fall within the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine. To fall within the special relationship exception on their negligent maintenance claim, the homeowners must establish: \u201c(1) there is direct contact or privity between the public official and the injured plaintiff which sets the latter apart from the general public, and (2) there are express assurances given by a public official, which (3) gives rise to justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d Taylor, 111 Wn.2d at 166.\nThe homeowners also contend that negligent maintenance occurred both to the drainage system on the developed site and off of the developed site. According to the homeowners, the drainage system for the Lakeview property had two components: foundation drains channeling water from the foundation area into a storm sewer system, and lines conducting water from the downspouts off site. The homeowners submitted facts tending to show that the drainage system was built so that it was not tightly lined into the storm sewer system but connected to an infiltration gallery. Instead of taking the surface water away from the site, it introduced the water to the area of the foundation. The defective drainage system was apparently buried before it was inspected by a representative of the city.\nThe Fukuis filed a claim with the city for flood damage, and were compensated. Aware of the drainage problems, the city installed catch basins in front of the Fukui residence. Ms. Fukui submitted an affidavit saying she relied on assurances from the city that it would maintain the storm drains. She has demonstrated, sufficient to defeat a claim for summary judgment, direct contact, express assurances, and justifiable reliance. She falls within the special relationship exception with regards to damages occasioned by actual negligence in maintaining the storm drain system. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, we conclude the city is not liable for negligently granting a permit to build on this site. We also hold the exculpatory covenant is valid to the extent it releases the city from liability resulting from soil movement \u201cresulting from . . . the issuance of the permit.\u201d The covenant does not, and may not, exculpate the city for soil movement-related losses caused by the city\u2019s own negligence. The homeowners may pursue claims against the city arising out of negligent maintenance of the storm and water drain system. Accordingly, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nAlexander, C.J., and Smith, Johnson, Madsen, Sanders, Ireland, Bridge, and Owens, JJ., concur.\nNo argument about the constitutionality or legality of this rule was made at any level; nor was any argument made about the appropriateness of covenants in the land use planning.\nBy its terms, this covenant does not exculpate the city for losses caused by its \u201csole negligence.\u201d Below, the city argued that any contributing cause other than its sole negligence would exculpate the city totally. Arguably, the city is advancing conditional sovereign immunity, but this issue was not raised to this Court, and so we will make no ruling on it.\nEquitable covenants date back to 1848. Tulk v. Moxhay, 2 Phillips 774, 41 Eng. Rep. 1143 (1848). Equitable covenants have a looser privity requirement. See Jesse Dukeminier & James E. Krier, Property 864 (3d ed. 1993).\nThe recently published Restatement (Third) of Property has abolished \u201ctouch and concern\u201d as an element of enforceable covenants. In its stead, the Restatement provides that a servitude is valid unless it is illegal, unconstitutional, or violates public policy. Restatement (Third) of Prop: Servitudes \u00a7 3.1 (2000). Whether this Court should adopt the Restatement was not raised until the motion for reconsideration to the Court of Appeals opinion, and will not be considered for the first time on review to this Court.\nThe city has argued below that the covenant should function as an express assumption of the risk. Given our disposition of the case, we decline to reach this argument.\nWe note a dispute in the briefs about whether competent evidence has been presented to establish the alleged negligence of the city caused the damage to the homeowners. Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals considered this issue. Given our disposition of the issues, we decline to consider it.",

    "Currens v. Sleek",
    "Durham, J.\n\u2014 Petitioners Cal and Elsa Currens (the Currenses) seek review of an unpublished Court of Appeals decision affirming the summary judgment dismissal of their complaint against Respondents Irene Sleek and Dennis Stephenson Logging (together, Respondents). At issue is whether liability may arise for property damage caused by an increased flow of surface water onto the Currenses\u2019 property after Sleek clear-cut and graded her land. We hold that the common enemy doctrine shields a landowner from liability for surface water flooding only if the landowner exercises due care in preventing unnecessary injury to neighboring properties. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the Respondents exercised due care, we reverse summary judgment and reinstate the Currenses\u2019 claim.\nI\nThe Currenses and Irene Sleek own neighboring property in Clark County. Water from a portion of the Sleek property naturally seeps into a forested, low-lying sink area on the Currenses\u2019 property. In 1993, Sleek decided to clear-cut her property in order to develop four home sites. As required by the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW Sleek submitted an Environmental Checklist to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The checklist indicated that Sleek would plant trees to enhance vegetation on the property and would install dry wells to mitigate storm water impacts.\nDennis Stephenson Logging clear-cut and graded Sleek\u2019s property in 1994. However, no action was taken to revegetate the land or to reduce the flow of surface water over the sites. No drywells were ever installed.\nThe following year, the natural sink area in the Currenses\u2019 property flooded, causing 11 trees to fall. The Currenses removed an additional 20 trees in order to ensure the safety of their home. A drainage engineer reported that \u201cthe logging on the Sleek property substantially increased the volume and peak flow rates of stormwater onto the Currenses\u2019 property, at the bottom of the natural drainage way and in the natural sink.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 92. He estimated this increase to be 3 times the natural volume that would accumulate during a large storm and 12 times the normal volume caused by a standard rainstorm. The engineer then concluded that the trees fell due to this increased runoff. The Currenses\u2019 tree expert and contractor supported this conclusion.\nThe Currenses filed suit against Respondents in April 1995. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissal on the grounds that Sleek was shielded from liability under the common enemy doctrine. The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Currenses petitioned this court for review, arguing that Sleek was liable because her actions were unreasonable and urging the court to reject the common enemy doctrine. The Washington Environmental Council has submitted an amicus brief.\nII\nThe issues in this appeal are governed by the common enemy doctrine, which has directed the law of surface water in Washington since 1896. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 P. 113 (1896). Surface water is \u201cvagrant or diffused [water] produced by rain, melting snow, or springs.\u201d King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 550, 384 P.2d 122 (1963). The Currenses contend that Sleek is liable for the damage brought about when the grading and construction on Sleek\u2019s property caused surface water to flow off of the property and to collect in a low point on the Currenses\u2019 land.\nIn its strictest form, the common enemy doctrine allows landowners to dispose of unwanted surface water in any way they see fit, without liability for resulting damage to one\u2019s neighbor. The idea is that \u201csurface water ... is regarded as an outlaw and a common enemy against which anyone may defend himself, even though by so doing injury may result to others.\u201d Cass, 14 Wash, at 78. Washington still adheres to the general common enemy rule that a landowner may develop his or her land without regard for the drainage consequences to other landowners. However, because a strict application of this rule is widely regarded as inequitable, this court has adopted several exceptions to the common enemy doctrine over the years.\nThe first exception provides that, although landowners may block the flow of diffuse surface water onto their land, they may not inhibit the flow of a watercourse or natural drainway. Island County v. Mackie, 36 Wn. App. 385, 388, 675 P.2d 607 (1984). Under this exception, a landowner who dams up a stream, gully, or drainway will not be shielded from liability under the common enemy doctrine. A natural drainway must be kept open to carry water into streams and lakes, and a lower proprietor cannot obstruct surface water when it is running in a natural drainage channel or depression. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 134 (1975).\nAn additional exception prevents landowners from collecting water and channeling it onto their neighbors\u2019 land. Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 875, 523 P.2d 186 (1974) (\u201cSurface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871 (1998). This rule prohibits a landowner from creating an unnatural conduit, but allows him or her to direct diffuse surface waters into preexisting natural waterways and drainways. Laurelon Terrace v. City of Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 892, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another.\u201d); Trigg v. Timmerman, 90 Wash. 678, 681-82, 156 P. 846 (1916) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along such depressions or drain ways may be hastened and incidentally increased by artificial means so long as the water is not diverted from its natural flow.\u201d).\nRead in conjunction with the above exceptions, the common enemy doctrine in Washington allows landowners to alter the flow of surface water to the detriment of their neighbors, so long as they do not block a watercourse or natural drainway, nor collect and discharge water onto their neighbors\u2019 land in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, its natural flow. These exceptions to the common enemy doctrine are not unique to Washington, but have been embraced by nearly every jurisdiction where the common enemy doctrine governs drainage liability. See Stanley V. Kinyon & Robert C. McClure, Interferences With Surface Waters, 24 Minn. L. Rev. 891, 916-17 (1940); Frank E. Maloney & Sheldon J. Plager, Diffused Surface Water: Scourge or Bounty ?, 8 Nat. Resources J. 72 (1968); Robert E. Beck, The Law of Drainage, in 5 Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 450.2 (Robert Emmet Clark ed., 1972).\nAt the heart of this appeal lies the parties\u2019 dispute over whether, and to what extent, Washington courts should also consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability for damage caused by excess surface water. Respondents argue that the common enemy doctrine in Washington does not allow a court to consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability. The Currenses assert that Washington has already recognized that the common enemy doctrine shields only reasonable conduct; a landowner who acts unreasonably may be liable for damages caused by surface water flooding.\nMost jurisdictions where the common enemy doctrine has been adopted as the basic rule have modified the doctrine by importing into it qualifications based upon concepts of reasonable use or negligence. 5 Beck, supra, \u00a7 451.2(C) (1972) (\u201cIn at least fifteen jurisdictions there is language in the opinions suggesting that a landowner must exercise \u2018due care\u2019 . . . .\u201d). Under this approach, landowners are free to alter the flow of surface water, subject to the exception that they must exercise their rights in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the property of adjacent owners. See, e.g., Young v. Moore, 241 Mo. App. 436, 236 S.W.2d 740, 744 (1951); Nichol v. Yocum, 173 Neb. 298, 113 N.W.2d 195, 199 (1962); Ballard v. Ace Wrecking Co., 289 A.2d 888, 889-90 (D.C. 1972). This due care exception thus serves to cushion the otherwise harsh allocation of rights under the common enemy doctrine. Although it does not affect a landowner\u2019s ability to alter the flow of surface water, it does require avoidance of unnecessary infringement upon a neighbor\u2019s free enjoyment of his or her property. Reutner v. Vouga, 367 S.W.2d 34, 41 (Mo. Ct. App. 1963). What this means in practical terms is that landowners may improve their land with impunity (subject to local land use and permitting requirements) and are not liable for damage caused by the change in the flow of surface water onto their neighbors\u2019 land, so long as the landowners act in good faith and do not damage adjacent property in excess of that called for by the particular project.\nWashington has never explicitly adopted a due care exception to its common enemy doctrine, but language in past cases indicates that landowner negligence has been a relevant factor in our decisions. In Wood v. City of Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 273-74, 119 P. 859 (1911), we stated that a landowner in developing land or fending off diffuse waters may be held liable for doing so negligently. We have also held that a landowner may not increase drainage of surface water into a drainway to such an extent that the capacity of the drain is overtaxed. Strickland v. City of Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 916-17, 385 P.2d 33 (1963). Furthermore, in both Laurelon, 40 Wn.2d 883 and Trigg, 90 Wash. 678, the court absolved the landowner who caused the flooding from liability, noting that there was no negligence. Finally, in Morris v. McNicol, 83 Wn.2d 491, 495, 519 P.2d 7 (1974), we stated that the common enemy doctrine would prevent liability only \u201cif the upland landowner\u2019s use is reasonable.\u201d We repeated this language with approval recently in DiBlasi v. City of Seattle, 136 Wn.2d 865, 969 P.2d 10 (1998). Because of these references, other jurisdictions have listed Washington as a jurisdiction that has incorporated a due care exception into its common enemy jurisprudence. Gregory C. Sisk, Toward a Unified Reasonable Use Approach to Water Drainage in Washington, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 61, 73 (1983) (citing Argyelan v. Haviland, 435 N.E.2d 973, 986 (Ind. 1982) (Hunter, J., dissenting); Pendergrast v. Aiken, 293 N.C. 201, 236 S.E.2d 787, 793 (1977); Chudzinski v. City of Sylvania, 53 Ohio App. 2d 151, 372 N.E.2d 611, 615 n.3 (1976); State v. Deetz, 66 Wis. 2d 1, 224 N.W.2d 407, 414 n.3 (1974)). See also Janet Fairchild, Annotation, Modern Status of Rules Governing Interference With Drainage Surface Waters, 93 A.L.R.3d, 1193, 1205-06 (1979).\nAlthough this court\u2019s references to a reasonableness requirement have been vague, the language in Wood, Morris, and DiBlasi indicates that Washington requires that a landowner exercise due care when engaging in activities that affect the flow of surface water. Furthermore, such an exception to the common enemy doctrine is mandated by the realities of increased development density in the state. Indeed, we know of no other jurisdiction in the country that still adheres to the traditional common enemy doctrine without some sort of requirement that landowners not unreasonably interfere with their neighbor\u2019s enjoyment of their property. We therefore unambiguously hold that under our common enemy jurisprudence, landowners who alter the flow of surface water on their property must exercise their rights with due care by acting in good faith and by avoiding unnecessary damage to the property of others.\nIll\nAmicus curiae Washington Environmental Council asks the court to reject our common enemy jurisprudence entirely and to adopt in its place the reasonable use rule. Under the reasonable use rule, a landowner is entitled to make reasonable use of his or her land, even if the use alters the flow of surface water, but the landowner may incur liability if the interference is unreasonable in light of the relative advantage to the actor and disadvantage to the neighbor. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 122 (1975). The rule has been adopted from the Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 822-31, 833 (1939) and has been paraphrased by other courts as the right of landowners to deal with surface water as they wish so long as their act is reasonable under all the circumstances. Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 80. The doctrine rests on tort principles and thus involves a case-by-case analysis, including consideration of the nature and importance of the improvements, the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the interference with the surface water, and the amount of injury. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 123 (1975). The reasonable use rule is akin to a nuisance cause of action and requires the court to weigh the utility of the improvements against the resulting damage to the adjacent property. Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 77.\nAt least 20 jurisdictions now employ the reasonable use rule to decide drainage liability cases. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 859 S.W.2d 681, 690 (Mo. 1993). Several commentators have urged the repudiation of the common enemy doctrine in favor of the reasonable use rule. See Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 85-89; Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 68 n.34. Advocates for the rule explain that it is less rigid and allows for increased flexibility in addressing surface water liability in a fact-specific manner. Id. In addition, the reasonable use rule is lauded because it shifts some of the costs inherent in increased urbanization back onto the developer. McGlashan v. Spade Rockledge Terrace Condo Dev. Corp., 62 Ohio St. 2d 55, 402 N.E.2d 1196, 1199 (1980).\nWe decline to abandon our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule. The critical difference between the two approaches is that the common enemy doctrine does not require any inquiry into the utility of the particular project. When determining liability under the common enemy doctrine, the due care exception requires the court to look only to whether the landowner has exercised due care in improving his or her land, i.e., whether the method employed by the landowner minimized any unnecessary impacts upon adjacent land. Unlike the reasonable use rule, a landowner\u2019s duty under the common enemy doctrine is not determined by weighing the nature and importance of the improvements against the damage caused to one\u2019s neighbor. Rather, a landowner has an unqualified right to embark on any improvements of his or her land allowed by law, but must limit the harm caused by changes in the flow of surface water to that which is reasonably necessary.\nA rule that requires parties to litigate the importance of a particular project in order to apportion liability is inconsistent with this state\u2019s historic deference to property rights. Furthermore, adopting the reasonable use rule would constitute an abrupt break with past precedent. In contrast, the common enemy doctrine, tempered by the due care exception, is consistent with the gradual evolution of our surface water drainage law. As Justice Hale said, \u201c[rjules of law, like governments, should not be changed for light or transient causes.\u201d State ex rel. Wash. State Finance Comm. v. Martin, 62 Wn.2d 645, 666, 384 P.2d 833 (1963). This court has applied the common enemy doctrine for over a century, and most recently in DiBlasi, 136 Wn.2d 865. We accordingly refuse the invitation to discard our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule.\nIV\nThe outcome of this appeal is thus determined by application of our common enemy doctrine. Respondents are not liable under the common enemy doctrine for flood damage caused by the improvements, unless, in the course of making those improvements, they blocked a.natural drain or waterway, collected and discharged water onto the neighbor\u2019s land, or failed to exercise due care in preventing unnecessary damage.\nUnder the facts of this case, it is clear that the first two exceptions to the common enemy doctrine do not apply. Respondents did not block the flow of a waterway or natural drain. Nor did they collect and discharge water onto the Currenses\u2019 property. In grading the land, the Respondents caused water that otherwise would have been absorbed into the ground to run off onto the Currenses\u2019 property. They did not construct culverts or ditches or artificially channel the water in any way. Rather, the water flowed in a diffuse fashion, by force of gravity, from a higher elevation to the sink hole on the Currenses\u2019 property.\nThe question here is whether the third exception applies to allow the Currenses to bring suit. The due care exception to the common enemy doctrine specifies that a landowner will be shielded from liability only where the changes in surface water flow are made both in good faith and in such a way as not to cause unnecessary damage. The Currenses have the burden of proof to show that the flooding damage of their property was a result of the Respondents\u2019 bad faith, or that it was in excess of that necessary for the completion of the project.\nThe Currenses assert that Sleek\u2019s failure to comply with the mitigation measures specified in the Environmental Checklist Sleek submitted to the DNR violates the due care exception. We do not now hold that the mere failure to comply with the Environmental Checklist in and of itself constitutes a lack of due care. However, such failure may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the Respondents acted in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the Currenses\u2019 property. Given that genuine issues of material fact exist, summary judgment is inappropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough we decline to reject our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule, we take the opportunity to clarify that Washington\u2019s law of drainage allows for a due care exception to the general rule against liability. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Respondents exercised due care, summary judgment is reversed.\nSmith, Johnson, Alexander, Talmadge, and Ireland, JJ., concur.\nThere are three general schemes employed in the United States to apportion liability for damage caused by surface water flooding. These approaches are: (1) the common enemy doctrine, (2) the civil law rule, and (3) the reasonable use rule. Only a handful of states still follow the common enemy doctrine, many having abandoned it in favor of the rule of reasonable use. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 859 S.W.2d 681, 690 (Mo. 1993) (listing 19 states that follow the reasonable use rule, 9 that follow the civil law rule, and 9 that follow the common enemy doctrine). For an extensive analysis of these three schemes, see Keys v. Romley, 64 Cal. 2d 396, 50 Cal. Rptr. 273, 412 P.2d 529 (1966).\nThe Court of Appeals mistakenly concluded that the common enemy doctrine was \u201cirrelevant\u201d in this case because Sleek did not intentionally alter surface water flow. The court implied that the common enemy doctrine applies only to situations where a landowner intentionally alters surface water flow, rather than inadvertently affecting the flow of surface water through development. There is no support in our case law for this distinction. The common enemy doctrine is a comprehensive scheme that governs the drainage of surface waters and it \u201capplies regardless of the purpose for which the drainage pattern of the land is altered, or whether the intent was actually to influence water flow.\u201d Gregory C. Sisk, Toward a Unified Reasonable Use Approach to Water Drainage in Washington, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 61, 74 n.66 (1983). See generally 3 Henry Phillip Farnham, The Law op W",

Washington still adheres to the general common enemy rule that a landowner may develop his or her land without regard for the drainage consequences to other landowners. However, because a strict application of this rule is widely regarded as inequitable, this court has adopted several exceptions to the common enemy doctrine over the years.\nThe first exception provides that, although landowners may block the flow of diffuse surface water onto their land, they may not inhibit the flow of a watercourse or natural drainway. Island County v. Mackie, 36 Wn. App. 385, 388, 675 P.2d 607 (1984). Under this exception, a landowner who dams up a stream, gully, or drainway will not be shielded from liability under the common enemy doctrine. A natural drainway must be kept open to carry water into streams and lakes, and a lower proprietor cannot obstruct surface water when it is running in a natural drainage channel or depression. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 134 (1975).\nAn additional exception prevents landowners from collecting water and channeling it onto their neighbors\u2019 land. Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 875, 523 P.2d 186 (1974) (\u201cSurface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871 (1998). This rule prohibits a landowner from creating an unnatural conduit, but allows him or her to direct diffuse surface waters into preexisting natural waterways and drainways. Laurelon Terrace v. City of Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 892, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another.\u201d); Trigg v. Timmerman, 90 Wash. 678, 681-82, 156 P. 846 (1916) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along such depressions or drain ways may be hastened and incidentally increased by artificial means so long as the water is not diverted from its natural flow.\u201d).\nRead in conjunction with the above exceptions, the common enemy doctrine in Washington allows landowners to alter the flow of surface water to the detriment of their neighbors, so long as they do not block a watercourse or natural drainway, nor collect and discharge water onto their neighbors\u2019 land in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, its natural flow. These exceptions to the common enemy doctrine are not unique to Washington, but have been embraced by nearly every jurisdiction where the common enemy doctrine governs drainage liability. See Stanley V. Kinyon & Robert C. McClure, Interferences With Surface Waters, 24 Minn. L. Rev. 891, 916-17 (1940); Frank E. Maloney & Sheldon J. Plager, Diffused Surface Water: Scourge or Bounty ?, 8 Nat. Resources J. 72 (1968); Robert E. Beck, The Law of Drainage, in 5 Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 450.2 (Robert Emmet Clark ed., 1972).\nAt the heart of this appeal lies the parties\u2019 dispute over whether, and to what extent, Washington courts should also consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability for damage caused by excess surface water. Respondents argue that the common enemy doctrine in Washington does not allow a court to consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability. The Currenses assert that Washington has already recognized that the common enemy doctrine shields only reasonable conduct; a landowner who acts unreasonably may be liable for damages caused by surface water flooding.\nMost jurisdictions where the common enemy doctrine has been adopted as the basic rule have modified the doctrine by importing into it qualifications based upon concepts of reasonable use or negligence. 5 Beck, supra, \u00a7 451.2(C) (1972) (\u201cIn at least fifteen jurisdictions there is language in the opinions suggesting that a landowner must exercise \u2018due care\u2019 . . . .\u201d). Under this approach, landowners are free to alter the flow of surface water, subject to the exception that they must exercise their rights in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the property of adjacent owners. See, e.g., Young v. Moore, 241 Mo. App. 436, 236 S.W.2d 740, 744 (1951); Nichol v. Yocum, 173 Neb. 298, 113 N.W.2d 195, 199 (1962); Ballard v. Ace Wrecking Co., 289 A.2d 888, 889-90 (D.C. 1972). This due care exception thus serves to cushion the otherwise harsh allocation of rights under the common enemy doctrine. Although it does not affect a landowner\u2019s ability to alter the flow of surface water, it does require avoidance of unnecessary infringement upon a neighbor\u2019s free enjoyment of his or her property. Reutner v. Vouga, 367 S.W.2d 34, 41 (Mo. Ct. App. 1963). What this means in practical terms is that landowners may improve their land with impunity (subject to local land use and permitting requirements) and are not liable for damage caused by the change in the flow of surface water onto their neighbors\u2019 land, so long as the landowners act in good faith and do not damage adjacent property in excess of that called for by the particular project.\nWashington has never explicitly adopted a due care exception to its common enemy doctrine, but language in past cases indicates that landowner negligence has been a relevant factor in our decisions. In Wood v. City of Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 273-74, 119 P. 859 (1911), we stated that a landowner in developing land or fending off diffuse waters may be held liable for doing so negligently. We have also held that a landowner may not increase drainage of surface water into a drainway to such an extent that the capacity of the drain is overtaxed. Strickland v. City of Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 916-17, 385 P.2d 33 (1963). Furthermore, in both Laurelon, 40 Wn.2d 883 and Trigg, 90 Wash. 678, the court absolved the landowner who caused the flooding from liability, noting that there was no negligence. Finally, in Morris v. McNicol, 83 Wn.2d 491, 495, 519 P.2d 7 (1974), we stated that the common enemy doctrine would prevent liability only \u201cif the upland landowner\u2019s use is reasonable.\u201d We repeated this language with approval recently in DiBlasi v. City of Seattle, 136 Wn.2d 865, 969 P.2d 10 (1998). Because of these references, other jurisdictions have listed Washington as a jurisdiction that has incorporated a due care exception into its common enemy jurisprudence. Gregory C. Sisk, Toward a Unified Reasonable Use Approach to Water Drainage in Washington, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 61, 73 (1983) (citing Argyelan v. Haviland, 435 N.E.2d 973, 986 (Ind. 1982) (Hunter, J., dissenting); Pendergrast v. Aiken, 293 N.C. 201, 236 S.E.2d 787, 793 (1977); Chudzinski v. City of Sylvania, 53 Ohio App. 2d 151, 372 N.E.2d 611, 615 n.3 (1976); State v. Deetz, 66 Wis. 2d 1, 224 N.W.2d 407, 414 n.3 (1974)). See also Janet Fairchild, Annotation, Modern Status of Rules Governing Interference With Drainage Surface Waters, 93 A.L.R.3d, 1193, 1205-06 (1979).\nAlthough this court\u2019s references to a reasonableness requirement have been vague, the language in Wood, Morris, and DiBlasi indicates that Washington requires that a landowner exercise due care when engaging in activities that affect the flow of surface water. Furthermore, such an exception to the common enemy doctrine is mandated by the realities of increased development density in the state. Indeed, we know of no other jurisdiction in the country that still adheres to the traditional common enemy doctrine without some sort of requirement that landowners not unreasonably interfere with their neighbor\u2019s enjoyment of their property. We therefore unambiguously hold that under our common enemy jurisprudence, landowners who alter the flow of surface water on their property must exercise their rights with due care by acting in good faith and by avoiding unnecessary damage to the property of others.\nIll\nAmicus curiae Washington Environmental Council asks the court to reject our common enemy jurisprudence entirely and to adopt in its place the reasonable use rule. Under the reasonable use rule, a landowner is entitled to make reasonable use of his or her land, even if the use alters the flow of surface water, but the landowner may incur liability if the interference is unreasonable in light of the relative advantage to the actor and disadvantage to the neighbor. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 122 (1975). The rule has been adopted from the Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 822-31, 833 (1939) and has been paraphrased by other courts as the right of landowners to deal with surface water as they wish so long as their act is reasonable under all the circumstances. Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 80. The doctrine rests on tort principles and thus involves a case-by-case analysis, including consideration of the nature and importance of the improvements, the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the interference with the surface water, and the amount of injury. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 123 (1975). The reasonable use rule is akin to a nuisance cause of action and requires the court to weigh the utility of the improvements against the resulting damage to the adjacent property. Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 77.\nAt least 20 jurisdictions now employ the reasonable use rule to decide drainage liability cases. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 859 S.W.2d 681, 690 (Mo. 1993). Several commentators have urged the repudiation of the common enemy doctrine in favor of the reasonable use rule. See Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 85-89; Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 68 n.34. Advocates for the rule explain that it is less rigid and allows for increased flexibility in addressing surface water liability in a fact-specific manner. Id. In addition, the reasonable use rule is lauded because it shifts some of the costs inherent in increased urbanization back onto the developer. McGlashan v. Spade Rockledge Terrace Condo Dev. Corp., 62 Ohio St. 2d 55, 402 N.E.2d 1196, 1199 (1980).\nWe decline to abandon our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule. The critical difference between the two approaches is that the common enemy doctrine does not require any inquiry into the utility of the particular project. When determining liability under the common enemy doctrine, the due care exception requires the court to look only to whether the landowner has exercised due care in improving his or her land, i.e., whether the method employed by the landowner minimized any unnecessary impacts upon adjacent land. Unlike the reasonable use rule, a landowner\u2019s duty under the common enemy doctrine is not determined by weighing the nature and importance of the improvements against the damage caused to one\u2019s neighbor. Rather, a landowner has an unqualified right to embark on any improvements of his or her land allowed by law, but must limit the harm caused by changes in the flow of surface water to that which is reasonably necessary.\nA rule that requires parties to litigate the importance of a particular project in order to apportion liability is inconsistent with this state\u2019s historic deference to property rights. Furthermore, adopting the reasonable use rule would constitute an abrupt break with past precedent. In contrast, the common enemy doctrine, tempered by the due care exception, is consistent with the gradual evolution of our surface water drainage law. As Justice Hale said, \u201c[rjules of law, like governments, should not be changed for light or transient causes.\u201d State ex rel. Wash. State Finance Comm. v. Martin, 62 Wn.2d 645, 666, 384 P.2d 833 (1963). This court has applied the common enemy doctrine for over a century, and most recently in DiBlasi, 136 Wn.2d 865. We accordingly refuse the invitation to discard our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule.\nIV\nThe outcome of this appeal is thus determined by application of our common enemy doctrine. Respondents are not liable under the common enemy doctrine for flood damage caused by the improvements, unless, in the course of making those improvements, they blocked a.natural drain or waterway, collected and discharged water onto the neighbor\u2019s land, or failed to exercise due care in preventing unnecessary damage.\nUnder the facts of this case, it is clear that the first two exceptions to the common enemy doctrine do not apply. Respondents did not block the flow of a waterway or natural drain. Nor did they collect and discharge water onto the Currenses\u2019 property. In grading the land, the Respondents caused water that otherwise would have been absorbed into the ground to run off onto the Currenses\u2019 property. They did not construct culverts or ditches or artificially channel the water in any way. Rather, the water flowed in a diffuse fashion, by force of gravity, from a higher elevation to the sink hole on the Currenses\u2019 property.\nThe question here is whether the third exception applies to allow the Currenses to bring suit. The due care exception to the common enemy doctrine specifies that a landowner will be shielded from liability only where the changes in surface water flow are made both in good faith and in such a way as not to cause unnecessary damage. The Currenses have the burden of proof to show that the flooding damage of their property was a result of the Respondents\u2019 bad faith, or that it was in excess of that necessary for the completion of the project.\nThe Currenses assert that Sleek\u2019s failure to comply with the mitigation measures specified in the Environmental Checklist Sleek submitted to the DNR violates the due care exception. We do not now hold that the mere failure to comply with the Environmental Checklist in and of itself constitutes a lack of due care. However, such failure may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the Respondents acted in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the Currenses\u2019 property. Given that genuine issues of material fact exist, summary judgment is inappropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough we decline to reject our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule, we take the opportunity to clarify that Washington\u2019s law of drainage allows for a due care exception to the general rule against liability. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Respondents exercised due care, summary judgment is reversed.\nSmith, Johnson, Alexander, Talmadge, and Ireland, JJ., concur.\nThere are three general schemes employed in the United States to apportion liability for damage caused by surface water flooding. These approaches are: (1) the common enemy doctrine, (2) the civil law rule, and (3) the reasonable use rule. Only a handful of states still follow the common enemy doctrine, many having abandoned it in favor of the rule of reasonable use. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 859 S.W.2d 681, 690 (Mo. 1993) (listing 19 states that follow the reasonable use rule, 9 that follow the civil law rule, and 9 that follow the common enemy doctrine). For an extensive analysis of these three schemes, see Keys v. Romley, 64 Cal. 2d 396, 50 Cal. Rptr. 273, 412 P.2d 529 (1966).\nThe Court of Appeals mistakenly concluded that the common enemy doctrine was \u201cirrelevant\u201d in this case because Sleek did not intentionally alter surface water flow. The court implied that the common enemy doctrine applies only to situations where a landowner intentionally alters surface water flow, rather than inadvertently affecting the flow of surface water through development. There is no support in our case law for this distinction. The common enemy doctrine is a comprehensive scheme that governs the drainage of surface waters and it \u201capplies regardless of the purpose for which the drainage pattern of the land is altered, or whether the intent was actually to influence water flow.\u201d Gregory C. Sisk, Toward a Unified Reasonable Use Approach to Water Drainage in Washington, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 61, 74 n.66 (1983).

Such is the general rule which denies imposition of liability on the owner of an upland estate for damages occasioned to his low-land neighbor by surface water drainage. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 78, 44 P. 113 (1896).\nTo this general rule of nonliability we have recognized two certain exceptions relating to blockage of a water course and/or collecting and channeling water onto one\u2019s neighbor\u2019s property. However, as the majority correctly observes, neither exception pertains here. So we are left with three choices: (1) we can affirm the trial court and the Court of Appeals by dismissing the action; (2) we can abandon the doctrine altogether; or (3) we can engraft a \u201creasonable use\u201d exception. The majority chooses the third, but I would repair to the first. Notwithstanding, even if the third course were open to us, I would not find these facts to flow within its banks.\nThe majority\u2019s reasons not to adopt a reasonable use \u201crule\u201d are equally applicable to rejection of a reasonable use \u201cexception.\u201d One such objection is that the reasonable use rule is \u201cinconsistent with this state\u2019s historic deference to property rights\u201d and the adoption of such a rule \u201cwould constitute an abrupt break with past precedent.\u201d Majority at 867. I would add, both the rule and the exception lack certainty and predictability. Both lead to an ad hoc jurisprudence. Commentators have found no difference in application between the reasonable use rule and the reasonable us e'exception.\nIf the common enemy rule says:\nYOU CAN TAMPER WITH NATURAL FLOW and the modification adds:\nIF YOUR CONDUCT IS REASONABLE and if the natural flow rule says:\nYOU CANNOT TAMPER WITH NATURAL FLOW and the modification adds:\nUNLESS YOUR CONDUCT IS REASONABLE then, there would seem to be no difference, and the summation would result in a new rule:\nYOU CAN OR CANNOT TAMPER WITH NATURAL FLOW DEPENDING UPON WHETHER YOUR CONDUCT IS OR IS NOT REASONABLE.\nThe only suggested difference is in \u201cthe practical question of prediction and proof.\u201d The notion is that with a modified natural flow rule, the burden is on one who interferes to show reasonable conduct, whereas with a modified common enemy rule, the premise is in favor of alteration and the person claiming damage has to show that the conduct was unreasonable. Such a distinction would seem to follow from the basic premise of each rule; if such a distinction exists, however, the cases on reasonable use modification have not made it clear.\n5 Robert E. Beck & Edward W. Clyde, Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 453.3, at 518 (Robert Emmet Clark ed., 1972) (footnote omitted).\nThe majority\u2019s attempt to \u201cunambiguously\u201d (Majority at 865) add some definition to what is or is not within the new exception is quite unsatisfactory:\nWhat this means in practical terms is that landowners may improve their land with impunity (subject to local land use and permitting requirements) and are not liable for damage caused by the change in the flow of surface water onto their neighbors\u2019 land, so long as the landowners act in good faith and do not damage adjacent property in excess of that called for by the particular project.\nMajority at 864. The difficulty with the majority\u2019s invented exception is amply demonstrated by the manner in which the majority attempts to apply it to the facts of this case. While the majority recognizes that landowners may improve their property \u201cwith impunity\u201d and are therefore \u201cnot liable for damage caused by the change in the flow of surface water onto their neighbors\u2019 land,\u201d the majority would only include within this rule of nonliability (1) \u201cact[s] in good faith\u201d which (2) \u201cdo not damage adjacent property in excess of that called for by the particular project.\u201d Majority at 864.\nHere the uphill landowner clear-cut a forested area to allow for future development. There is no claim that this clear-cut was unreasonable or unnecessary for either the development or, for that matter, the harvest of timber. Nor is there any claim that the clear-cut was accomplished in an extraordinary or unusual manner, although all concede clear-cutting trees may increase diffuse surface drainage. Significantly, there is no evidence removal of these trees either blocked a water course or collected or channeled water. The common-law rule imposes no liability on the uphill landowner due to a mere increase in surface drainage which his development might occasion. Hedlund v. White, 67 Wn. App. 409, 416 n.10, 836 P.2d 250 (1992) (\u201c[A]n uphill owner may incidentally increase the quantity or velocity of surface water in a natural watercourse or drain, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow.\u201d); Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 876, 523 P.2d 186 (1974) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that the amount of water reaching the plaintiffs land, by reason of the development of the platted lands, might be greater than it formerly was, would not entitle it to compensation for any resulting damage.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871 (1998).\nTherefore the proper legal conclusion is that the increased runoff occasioned by this project would not, under any construction of the established rule, impose liability on the uphill landowner.\nIndeed the only thing the uphill landowner failed to do was prevent runoff onto his downhill neighbor by constructing a dry well, dam, or intersecting ditch. While he or she could have done those things, it is the very purpose of the traditional rule to relieve the uphill landowner of that responsibility, casting it instead upon the lowland owner. To say then that the uphill landowner is required to exercise \u201cdue care\u201d in the sense that the uphill landowner must not discharge surface water onto the lowland estate is to allow the so-called exception to devour the rule. Even jurisdictions that subscribe to the reasonable use \u201cexception\u201d do not premise a lack of due care upon the failure to construct a drainage ditch. See, e.g., Ballard v. Ace Wrecking Co., 289 A.2d 888, 890 (D.C. 1972) (\u201c[S]ince the defendants did nothing more than clear the land in a manner which was reasonable and non-negligent as they were entitled to do for the purposes of demolition and new construction . . . there . . . [is] no duty on their part to construct a drainage ditch . . . .\u201d).\nBut now the majority has apparently imposed an undefined duty upon the upland owner to use \u201cdue care\u201d not to discharge increased surface waters onto the lowland property even though those surface waters are the necessary result of the development of the land for civilized use. By predictable consequence, every time the lowland property owner experiences water damage attributable to drainage he will have a potential claim against the upland owner for failure to use \u201cdue care\u201d to prevent the water from flowing onto his property in the first place. Although the majority casts its rule as \u201cthe opportunity to clarify\u201d Washington\u2019s drainage law (Majority at 869), in point of fact it is a total abrogation of the certain rule of nonliability in such situations.\nMoreover, if we impose a duty of \u201cdue care,\u201d how do we determine when that duty has been discharged? The majority apparently defers this question to the jury without further definition, thereby inviting lack of certainty and ad hoc decision-making. It does suggest, however, that the failure of a landowner to conform to his environmental checklist may be \u201cconsidered by the trier of fact\u201d (Majority at 868), although the majority does not purport to limit the duty of due care simply to variations from an environmental checklist, nor even hold such lack of conformity, if found, demonstrates lack of due care (\u201cWe do not now hold that the mere failure to comply with the Environmental Checklist in and of itself constitutes a lack of due care.\u201d Majority at 868). Unless we can identify a factual basis in this record which, if proved, would support the conclusion that this property owner has not exercised due care, we have no business remanding this case for a useless trial. Olympic Fish Prods., Inc. v. Lloyd, 93 Wn.2d 596, 602, 611 P.2d 737 (1980) (purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to avoid useless trials when no genuine issue of material fact exists).\nThe majority cites no authority in support of its claim that breach of a permit condition, much less variation from an environmental checklist, may even be \u201cconsidered\u201d by the trier of fact to impose a duty on an upland landowner to benefit his lowland neighbor. I would not casually announce such a far-reaching doctrine without argument, briefs, and precedential authority, none of which is present here.\nThe State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA) checklist supplied to the Department of Natural Resources stated runoff water \u201cwill flow into dry wells.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 57. Compliance with SEPA may be a condition precedent to permit issuance although it is not a permit in and of itself. An environmental checklist is an informational document submitted to the responsible official to assist his threshold determination as to whether further environmental review is necessary or appropriate. The checklist may be helpful to determine if the project has a probable significant adverse environmental impact. RCW 43.21C.031. At most a misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure in an environmental checklist allows the responsible official to withdraw the determination of non-significance. WAC 197-ll-340(3)(a)(iii). But even if it were ultimately appropriate to mitigate or deny a project pursuant to SEPA, such mitigation or denial must be based upon a formally designated policy, plan, rule, or regulation to pass legal muster. WAC 197-ll-660(l)(a). But there is no evidence of such a formally adopted regulation requiring dry wells in this record.\nIn the final analysis the majority\u2019s imposition of a generalized duty of \u201cdue care\u201d is not a clarification of preexisting law but its complete abrogation. Moreover, the only facts of record suggesting the uphill landowner failed to use \u201cdue care\u201d in this case is the failure of the uphill landowner to take positive preventive measures to divert the natural flow of surface water away from the downhill property. The common law does not impose such a duty, nor does our precedent, nor does precedent from even those jurisdictions which have adopted the reasonable use exception. If the majority wants to reach such a result, thereby abrogating the applicable rule in favor of uncertainty and chaos, it should first overrule prior precedent and provide a justification for doing so. But it does not, and I cannot. Therefore I dissent.\nGuy, C.J., and Madsen, J., concur with Sanders, J.\nAfter modification, further reconsideration denied December 14, 1999.\nEven if we were to impose a duty on the upland owner to capture his surface water, I cannot imagine how the majority would impose a similar duty upon the logging company, the dismissal of which is also reversed by the majority.",

    "Dempsey v. City of Seattle",
    "Holcomb, J.\nOn December 18, 1932, appellant\u2019s premises at a certain address in Seattle were temporarily flooded tbrougb tbe breaking of a city water main. On January 14, 1933, appellant filed a claim for damages to tbe personal property in bis premises resulting from tbe flooding. That claim was rejected for insufficiency in form. It contained no items for damages to tbe real estate, except it claimed six dollars for renewal of tbe drain to tbe basement, wbicb drain was alleged to have been filled with sand and mud.\nOn August 10, 1933, appellant filed the claim upon which this action is based. The claim and complaint are founded upon the theory that the breaking of the water main and the resulting flooding of his premises were due to the negligence of the city, alleging* that the flood caused a subsidence and sinking of the ground under his house which caused the house to buckle and crack, which subsidence and consequent damage were not discovered nor discoverable by him until July 12, 1933, which was all within thirty days before that claim was filed.\nSection 29, Art. IY, of the charter of Seattle provides :\n\u201cAll claims for damages against the city must be presented to the city council and filed with the clerk within thirty days after the time when such claim for damages accrued, . . .\u201d\nThe proof showed, and the trial court found, that appellant had suffered considerable damage by the subsidence of the house after his original claim had been filed; that, by reason of such sudden and violent flooding, soil and dirt upon which appellant\u2019s house was erected was washed away and there was deposited in the basement mud and silt; that, by reason of the removal of soil and dirt from thereunder, the house thereafter subsided, cracked and buckled in several places; that the subsidence of the house commenced at the time of the flood upon the removal of such lateral support and was due directly thereto, although the full effect of such subsidence and damage was not apparent to appellant until on or about July 12, 1933; that such damage to appellant\u2019s house began at the time of the breaking of the water main, and that he knew or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have ascertained on or prior to January 14, 1932, that portions of the soil supporting the house had been removed by tbe action of the flood waters and that the house might or probably would subside, crack or buckle as a result thereof; and that he had failed to file a proper claim within thirty days after the accrual of his claim, as provided by the above-quoted provision of the Seattle charter. The trial court accordingly concluded that appellant was entitled to recover nothing and dismissed his action with prejudice.\nOn appeal, as grounds for reversal, appellant forcefully contends that no probability of future damage could possibly have been apparent within the thirty days following the flood, and that the damage arose from a trespass resulting in a continuing nuisance, and that the damage sued for was not apparent, material, or reasonably discoverable, prior to July 12 to 15, 1933.\nIt is unquestionable, of course, that the damage which resulted from the breaking of the main and the flooding of appellant\u2019s premises was not one arising from any taking or damaging of the property under the eminent domain provision of our constitution and laws. Willett v. Seattle, 96 Wash. 632, 165 Pac. 876. That being established, it is equally certain that the injury constituted a tort, and the resultant damages were damages arising in tort.\nThe record shows that the flood waters receded within a few hours after the main burst. The removal of the soil supporting the house occurred at the time of the flood, even though the full effect of the damages may not have been ascertained by appellant until later.\nAppellant relies largely upon Doran v. Seattle, 24 Wash. 182, 64 Pac. 230, 54 A. L. R. 532, 85 Am. St. 948; Sterrett v. Northport Mining & Smelting co., 30 Wash. 164, 70 Pac. 266; Brisky v. Leavenworth Logging, Boom & Water Co., 68 Wash. 386, 123 Pac. 519; Marks v. Seattle, 88 Wash. 61, 152 Pac. 706; and certain cases from other states and England.\nThe Doran case, supra, arose ont of building a bulkhead in a street, which was held to be a continuing nuisance. The Marks case, supra, involved the removal of lateral support outside the confines of the owner\u2019s property which caused a slide that gradually progressed until it invaded his property. The Sterrett case, supra, was an action involving the destruction of land by fumes from a smelter, which obviously constituted a continuing nuisance. One case, Backhouse v. Bonomi, 1 Best & Smith 970 (England), has been rejected by other courts in this country (Noonan v. Pardee, 200 Pa. 474, 50 Atl. 255), and has sometimes been disregarded in England.\nWe can find no cases from this court esaetly in point on this question of when such an action accrues so as to start the running of the statute of limitations as to filing a claim for damages. Some cases relied upon by appellant do not involve that question.\nOases in actions for personal injuries, or for insurance, such as Fee v. Department of Labor & Industries, 151 Wash. 337, 275 Pac..741, where the original injury progressed until it culminated in a final, definite result, are not in point. Such injury arises from one cause of a continuing development and result.\nIn Bennett v. Thorne, 36 Wash. 253, 78 Pac. 936, 68 A. L. R. 113, we said:\n\u201cA right of action ordinarily accrues by reason of some wrong, default or delict of the defendant \u2014 his infringement of a right of the plaintiff, or a failure in duty he owes to the plaintiff. \u2018 The elements of any cause of action are: (1) A right possessed by the plaintiff; (2) and infringement of such right by the defendant.\u2019 \u2018A right claimed or wrong suffered by the plaintiff, on the one hand, and the duty or delict of the defendant on the other.\u2019 [Citing cases.]\u201d\nIn Collins v. Spokane, 64 Wash. 153, 116 Pac. 663, it is held that the filing of a claim for damages within the period prescribed by such a charter provision as that above quoted is mandatory.\nWhile we have never directly so held, the Willett case, supra, apparently inferentially holds that a claim upon a cause of action for damages from the negligent flooding' of real estate accrues at the time of the flood or original trespass. That is the effect of the decision in Kansas Pac. Railway v. Mihlman, 17 Kans. 224, and also in Fowlkes v. Nashville & Decatur R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, and American Exchange National Bank v. Keeley, 39 S. W. (2d). (Tex. Civ. App.) 929.\nOne case almost on all fours with this case is found in National Lead Co. v. New York, 43 F. (2d) 914, where the circuit court of appeals said: We conclude that tbe judgment of tbe trial court is right, and it is affirmed.\n\u201cThere was one act of negligence in laying the main with a faulty pipe section, one consequent breaking of the pipe, and one inflow of water resulting in immediate damage which gave rise to a cause of action that accrued at once. The decisive feature is that that cause of action has been made the basis of this suit against the city and all damage resulting from the one flooding is traceable directly to the one break. The plaintiff had a single right of action for all damage caused by the one act of negligence, and it accrued when the damage began, instead of, as the plaintiff seems to believe, when the damage was completely done. If no right of action accrues when some damage is done, but only when all the damage has been suffered, all a defendant would need to show in defense would be that suit was brought while the plaintiff continued to suffer damage or that future damages would be sustained. On such a theory a defendant would be immune from suit while the harmful effect of its wrongdoing continued. On the contrary, a plaintiff, any especial requirement for notice aside, has the rig'ht to sue upon being* injured and to recover in one suit whatever damage is done without any new\nact of negligence by tbe defendant, no matter how numerous tbe items of damage may be or that they do not occur simultaneously. Tbe true test for determining whether one or more than one cause of action accrues, lies not in tbe number and variety of tbe items of damage but in whether or not all of tbe damage was caused by one and tbe same negligent act. Tbe negligence causing tbe flooding was tbe breach of duty which ripened into a cause of action when the damage began. As soon as tbe negligent cause was counteracted, and this happened when tbe water was turned off about an hour after tbe break, tbe city ceased to violate any duty it owed tbe plaintiff. It was bound then only to compensate tbe plaintiff, provided tbe conditions precedent as to notice required by its charter were fulfilled, for tbe damage occasioned by its negligence which, though it no longer existed, bad not entirely spent its force. All such damage arose from a single tort for which recovery could be bad in one action.\u201d\nMaih, Mitchell, Blake, and Geraghty, JJ., concur.",

            "text": "Holcomb, J.\nOn December 18, 1932, appellant\u2019s premises at a certain address in Seattle were temporarily flooded tbrougb tbe breaking of a city water main. On January 14, 1933, appellant filed a claim for damages to tbe personal property in bis premises resulting from tbe flooding. That claim was rejected for insufficiency in form. It contained no items for damages to tbe real estate, except it claimed six dollars for renewal of tbe drain to tbe basement, wbicb drain was alleged to have been filled with sand and mud.\nOn August 10, 1933, appellant filed the claim upon which this action is based. The claim and complaint are founded upon the theory that the breaking of the water main and the resulting flooding of his premises were due to the negligence of the city, alleging* that the flood caused a subsidence and sinking of the ground under his house which caused the house to buckle and crack, which subsidence and consequent damage were not discovered nor discoverable by him until July 12, 1933, which was all within thirty days before that claim was filed.\nSection 29, Art. IY, of the charter of Seattle provides :\n\u201cAll claims for damages against the city must be presented to the city council and filed with the clerk within thirty days after the time when such claim for damages accrued, . . .\u201d\nThe proof showed, and the trial court found, that appellant had suffered considerable damage by the subsidence of the house after his original claim had been filed; that, by reason of such sudden and violent flooding, soil and dirt upon which appellant\u2019s house was erected was washed away and there was deposited in the basement mud and silt; that, by reason of the removal of soil and dirt from thereunder, the house thereafter subsided, cracked and buckled in several places; that the subsidence of the house commenced at the time of the flood upon the removal of such lateral support and was due directly thereto, although the full effect of such subsidence and damage was not apparent to appellant until on or about July 12, 1933; that such damage to appellant\u2019s house began at the time of the breaking of the water main, and that he knew or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have ascertained on or prior to January 14, 1932, that portions of the soil supporting the house had been removed by tbe action of the flood waters and that the house might or probably would subside, crack or buckle as a result thereof; and that he had failed to file a proper claim within thirty days after the accrual of his claim, as provided by the above-quoted provision of the Seattle charter. The trial court accordingly concluded that appellant was entitled to recover nothing and dismissed his action with prejudice.\nOn appeal, as grounds for reversal, appellant forcefully contends that no probability of future damage could possibly have been apparent within the thirty days following the flood, and that the damage arose from a trespass resulting in a continuing nuisance, and that the damage sued for was not apparent, material, or reasonably discoverable, prior to July 12 to 15, 1933.\nIt is unquestionable, of course, that the damage which resulted from the breaking of the main and the flooding of appellant\u2019s premises was not one arising from any taking or damaging of the property under the eminent domain provision of our constitution and laws. Willett v. Seattle, 96 Wash. 632, 165 Pac. 876. That being established, it is equally certain that the injury constituted a tort, and the resultant damages were damages arising in tort.\nThe record shows that the flood waters receded within a few hours after the main burst. The removal of the soil supporting the house occurred at the time of the flood, even though the full effect of the damages may not have been ascertained by appellant until later.\nAppellant relies largely upon Doran v. Seattle, 24 Wash. 182, 64 Pac. 230, 54 A. L. R. 532, 85 Am. St. 948; Sterrett v. Northport Mining & Smelting co., 30 Wash. 164, 70 Pac. 266; Brisky v. Leavenworth Logging, Boom & Water Co., 68 Wash. 386, 123 Pac. 519; Marks v. Seattle, 88 Wash. 61, 152 Pac. 706; and certain cases from other states and England.\nThe Doran case, supra, arose ont of building a bulkhead in a street, which was held to be a continuing nuisance. The Marks case, supra, involved the removal of lateral support outside the confines of the owner\u2019s property which caused a slide that gradually progressed until it invaded his property. The Sterrett case, supra, was an action involving the destruction of land by fumes from a smelter, which obviously constituted a continuing nuisance. One case, Backhouse v. Bonomi, 1 Best & Smith 970 (England), has been rejected by other courts in this country (Noonan v. Pardee, 200 Pa. 474, 50 Atl. 255), and has sometimes been disregarded in England.\nWe can find no cases from this court esaetly in point on this question of when such an action accrues so as to start the running of the statute of limitations as to filing a claim for damages. Some cases relied upon by appellant do not involve that question.\nOases in actions for personal injuries, or for insurance, such as Fee v. Department of Labor & Industries, 151 Wash. 337, 275 Pac..741, where the original injury progressed until it culminated in a final, definite result, are not in point. Such injury arises from one cause of a continuing development and result.\nIn Bennett v. Thorne, 36 Wash. 253, 78 Pac. 936, 68 A. L. R. 113, we said:\n\u201cA right of action ordinarily accrues by reason of some wrong, default or delict of the defendant \u2014 his infringement of a right of the plaintiff, or a failure in duty he owes to the plaintiff. \u2018 The elements of any cause of action are: (1) A right possessed by the plaintiff; (2) and infringement of such right by the defendant.\u2019 \u2018A right claimed or wrong suffered by the plaintiff, on the one hand, and the duty or delict of the defendant on the other.\u2019 [Citing cases.]\u201d\nIn Collins v. Spokane, 64 Wash. 153, 116 Pac. 663, it is held that the filing of a claim for damages within the period prescribed by such a charter provision as that above quoted is mandatory.\nWhile we have never directly so held, the Willett case, supra, apparently inferentially holds that a claim upon a cause of action for damages from the negligent flooding' of real estate accrues at the time of the flood or original trespass. That is the effect of the decision in Kansas Pac. Railway v. Mihlman, 17 Kans. 224, and also in Fowlkes v. Nashville & Decatur R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, and American Exchange National Bank v. Keeley, 39 S. W. (2d). (Tex. Civ. App.) 929.\nOne case almost on all fours with this case is found in National Lead Co. v. New York, 43 F. (2d) 914, where the circuit court of appeals said: We conclude that tbe judgment of tbe trial court is right, and it is affirmed.\n\u201cThere was one act of negligence in laying the main with a faulty pipe section, one consequent breaking of the pipe, and one inflow of water resulting in immediate damage which gave rise to a cause of action that accrued at once. The decisive feature is that that cause of action has been made the basis of this suit against the city and all damage resulting from the one flooding is traceable directly to the one break. The plaintiff had a single right of action for all damage caused by the one act of negligence, and it accrued when the damage began, instead of, as the plaintiff seems to believe, when the damage was completely done. If no right of action accrues when some damage is done, but only when all the damage has been suffered, all a defendant would need to show in defense would be that suit was brought while the plaintiff continued to suffer damage or that future damages would be sustained. On such a theory a defendant would be immune from suit while the harmful effect of its wrongdoing continued. On the contrary, a plaintiff, any especial requirement for notice aside, has the rig'ht to sue upon being* injured and to recover in one suit whatever damage is done without any new\nact of negligence by tbe defendant, no matter how numerous tbe items of damage may be or that they do not occur simultaneously. Tbe true test for determining whether one or more than one cause of action accrues, lies not in tbe number and variety of tbe items of damage but in whether or not all of tbe damage was caused by one and tbe same negligent act. Tbe negligence causing tbe flooding was tbe breach of duty which ripened into a cause of action when the damage began. As soon as tbe negligent cause was counteracted, and this happened when tbe water was turned off about an hour after tbe break, tbe city ceased to violate any duty it owed tbe plaintiff. It was bound then only to compensate tbe plaintiff, provided tbe conditions precedent as to notice required by its charter were fulfilled, for tbe damage occasioned by its negligence which, though it no longer existed, bad not entirely spent its force. All such damage arose from a single tort for which recovery could be bad in one action.\u201d\nMaih, Mitchell, Blake, and Geraghty, JJ., concur.",

            "text": "Steinert, J.\n(dissenting) \u2014 As I read tbe evidence in this case, tbe damage to appellant\u2019s property, for which this action was brought, did not occur until July 12, 1933, which was six or seven months after tbe water main broke. At tbe time that tbe actual flooding took place, tbe damage was considered superficial and trivial. In fact, immediately after tbe breaking of tbe water main, tbe city repaired what then appeared to be tbe actual damage. It appears, however, that tbe water bad washed away some of the dirt underneath tbe bouse, but tbe effect of this did not become apparent, and was not foreseen, until tbe land actually subsided, carrying tbe bouse with it. As tbe result of tbe subsidence, appellant has been actually damaged, as tbe court found, in tbe sum of five bun-dred ninety dollars. The claim was filed within thirty days after the real damage occurred.\nHad appellant filed a claim for the amount just mentioned within thirty days after the breaking of the water main, manifestly he could not have recovered, because his damages then were conjectural and not subject to proof. In other words, the damage had not yet occurred. The cause of action, therefore, had not accrued.\n\u201c \u2018The accrual of the cause of action\u2019 means the right to institute and maintain a suit; and whenever one person may sue another a cause of action has accrued and the statute begins to run, but not until that time. So, whether at law or in equity, the cause of action arises when and only when the aggrieved party has the right to apply to the proper tribunals for relief. The statute does not attach to a claim for which there is no right of action, and does not run against' a right for which there is no corresponding remedy or for which judgment cannot be obtained. The true test therefore to determine when a cause of action has accrued is to ascertain the time when plaintiff could first have maintained his action to a successful result. The fact that he might previously have brought a premature or groundless action is immaterial. The statute of limitation does not require a person to institute proceedings to enforce a right within a time limited, when such proceedings will not conclusively determine such right as to each party.\u201d 37 C. J. 810, 811.\nThis court has held that an action to recover damages for an injury cannot be maintained until the injury actually occurs. Smith v. Seattle, 18 Wash. 484, 51 Pac. 1057, 63 Am. St. 910. This is true, even though it may be apparent at the time that injury will inevitably result. Sterrett v. Nortlvport Mining & Smelting Co., 30 Wash. 164, 176, 70 Pac. 266.\nWhen the results of a wrongful act cannot be clearly foreseen, the statute is operative only from the time that sustainable injury occurs, or when damages are discoverable by due diligence. Beck v. American Rio Grande Land & Irr. Co., 39 S. W. (2d) (Tex. Civ. App.) 640.'\nIn 1 American Jurisprudence, p. 451, \u00a7 60, the rule, in its general application and with its exceptions, is stated as follows:\n\u201cIn determining whether an action has been prematurely commenced or whether it has been so tardily commenced as to be barred by the Statute of Limitations, it becomes necessary to determine when the cause of action accrued. This is determined by ascertainment of the time when the plaintiff could first have maintained his action to enforce his cause of action. Generally, it may be said that a cause of action accrues at the moment of a wrong, default, or delict by the defendant and the injury of the plaintiff, although the actual damage resulting therefrom may not be discovered until some time afterwards, if the injury, however slight, is complete at the time of the act. \"Where the invasion of a right (as by the erection of a permanent structure on the land of another), if submitted to on the one hand and persisted in on the other a sufficient length of time, may result in the extinction of the right, a remedy may be sought before actual damage has occurred. But if an act is not legally injurious until certain consequences occur, it is not the mere doing of the act that gives rise to a cause of action, but the subsequent occurrence of damage or loss as the consequence of the act, and therefore, in such case, no cause of action accrues until the loss or damage occurs.\u201d (Italics mine.)\nThis case falls squarely within the exception stated in the concluding part of the above quotation. The act of the city was not legally injurious until the consequences appeared, and appellant\u2019s cause of action did not accrue until the loss or damage occurred.\nI think that the judgment should be reversed.\nMillard, C.

Neither does it appear that any reasonable investigation, such as even the exercise of abundant precaution would suggest, would then have disclosed the dangerous situation which later resulted in the damage complained of.\nThe law gives to certain municipal corporations the very great advantage of what is, in effect, an extremely short statute of limitations. While these statutes must be given every reasonable effect, I cannot agree that they should operate to bar a meritorious claim for damages based upon a situation concerning which the claimant was, in fact, ignorant, which it cannot be held he should have known, and concerning which no reasonable investigation would have disclosed the damage. A claimant must, at his peril, take notice of what the law requires that he know, and make every effort to fully advise himself as to any claim which he may have against a municipal corporation; but, under the circumstances here disclosed, I am convinced that it cannot be held that appellant should have known of the damage before his house actually settled. This being true, he had the statutory period after that date within which to present his claim.\nI accordingly dissent from the conclusion reached by the majority.\nTolmakt, J., concurs with Beals, J.",
